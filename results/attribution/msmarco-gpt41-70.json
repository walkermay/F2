            "The mix-up of their identities leads to the wrongful death of the poet Cinna: this, too, is thought to be historically accurate. The Greek biographer Plutarch states that the Cinna killed by the mob of angry Roman's following Julius Caesar's death was a poet. Cinna the conspirator strongly disapproved of how Julius Caesar ran the Roman Empire. He was the leader of a popular political party whose views were essentially anti-aristocratic. In the play Julius Caesar, he is one of the key conspirators to plan Caesar's death. He is the one who first plants the idea of inviting Marcus Brutus to join their cause: he suggests this to Cassius.",
            "Brutus forces Caesar to go to the Senate by telling him that it would be womanish for him not to go. When Caesar arrives at the Senate, the conspirators move toward him. The assassination begins and when it is over, Caesar has over thirty-five stab wounds. Ironically, Caesar falls at the foot of Pompey's statue. The death of Pompey created many problems for Caesar since Pompey himself had many followers in Rome. That was one thing at the root of Caesar's assassination, among many.",

            "The first person that lets the audience know that someone has spoken out of turn about the conspiracy comes to the forefront in Act II, Scene iii. It is Artemidorus, the teacher, who favors Caesar and wants to warn him. He has written a letter that he hopes Caesar will read before he enters the senate. In his letter, Artemidorus names the conspirators and informs Caesar that these men are determined to assassinate him.",

            "Let Antony and Caesar fall together. (2.1.168-174). By suggesting that they also murder Antony, Cassius removes the veil of honor from the plan. This isn't simply about protecting Rome from tyranny; it's making practical moves to protect them from further annoyances in whatever it is they plan after the murder.",

They made him believe that Caesar only wanted power and was going to try for King. Brutus believed them and so from there he wanted Julius Caesar to die.",
            "He writes a letter of warning to Caesar, telling him to beware of all the chief conspirators, naming them singly. He hopes to be able to hand it to Caesar personally as he passes: If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;",

            "But by the mid-20th century and after, thanks to improvements in ground-based telescopes and the development of robotic space probes, many more moons would be discovered. Neptune now has 14 recognized satellites, and in honor of of their parent planet, all are named for minor water deities in Greek mythology.",
            "Early telescopic discoveries. Due to Neptune's distance from Earth, only two moons were confirmed with ground telescopes before Voyager 2. The first one, Triton, was actually discovered only 17 days after the planet itself was found.",
            "Uranus was discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781. Herschel was probably the most famous astronomer of the 18th century. In addition to discovering the planet Uranus, he also observed and cataloged over 800 double stars and 2,500 nebulae.e was the first astronomer to correctly describe the spiral structure of our Milky Way Galaxy. Neptune was discovered by John Couch Adams in 1846. Adams was an English astronomer and mathematician who, at the age of 24, was the first person to predict the position of a planetary mass beyond Uranus.",
            "Who Discovered Neptune. The fourth biggest planet in the Solar System, Neptune is named after the god of the sea, Neptune, from Roman mythology.",
            "Neptune is about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the sun. Because Neptune is so far from the sun, it receives very little sunlight. In fact, the sunlight that reaches Neptune is 900 times less intense than the sunlight that reaches Earth.",
            "How did Neptune get its name? The Romans named the five planets closest to the Sun after their most important gods. These were the only planets that were bright enough for them to see. Later, when telescopes were used, other planets were discovered. Astronomers decided to continue naming the planets after Roman Gods. Neptune, a blueish planet, was named after the Roman god of the sea.",
            "Neptune Facts. Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and last of the known planets. While it is the third largest planet with respect to mass, it is only the fourth largest in terms of diameter. Due to its blue coloration, Neptune was named after the Roman god of the Sea.",
            "The largest Neptunian moon, Triton, was discovered just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered. Neptune has a storm similar the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. It is commonly known as the Great Dark Spot and is roughly the size of Earth. Neptune also has a second storm called the Small Dark Spot.",
            "Neptune cannot be seen without a large telescope and was first seen in 1846 from the observatory in Berlin. BUT, the existence of Neptune had actually been \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscovered\u00e2\u0080\u009d a year earlier, in 1845. Neptune is the 8th planet from the Sun. Uranus, the 7th planet, was first discovered by means of a telescope in 1781.",
            "Neptune's atmosphere, like Jupiter's and Saturn's, is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen; it contains a higher proportion of ices such as water, ammonia, and methane.",
            "That reservoir later became known as the Oort cloud. Earlier, in 1943, astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth had suggests comets and larger bodies might exist beyond Neptune. In 1951, astronomer Gerard Kuiper predicted the existence of a belt of icy objects that now bears his name.",
            "Many of these can't be seen from the Earth with the Hubble Space Telescope, but large changes in the atmosphere of Neptune are visible. As with Uranus, the color of Neptune is due to methane in its atmosphere, even though the main components of the atmosphere are hydrogen and helium.",
            "by Fraser Cain on November 27, 2008. The color of Neptune is a bright azure blue. During its flyby in 1989, NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Voyager 2 revealed the bright blue color, different from the pale blue color of Uranus.mage credit: NASA. The answer to Neptune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s color comes from its cloud tops. The upper atmosphere of Neptune is made up of 80% hydrogen, 19% helium with a trace 1% amount of methane and other ices, like ammonia and water.",
            "When the spacecraft visited the Neptunian system, Neptune was the farthest known body in the Solar system. It was not until 1999, that Pluto was further from the Sun in its trajectory. Voyager 2 studied Neptune's atmosphere, Neptune's rings, its magnetosphere, and Neptune's moons. The Neptunian system had been studied scientifically for many years with telescopes and indirect methods, but the close inspection by the Voyager 2 probe settled many issues and revealed a plethora of information that could not have been obtained otherwise.",
            "NASA's Voyager 2 satellite was the first and as yet only spacecraft to visit Neptune on Aug. 25, 1989. The satellite discovered Neptune's rings and six of the planet's moons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Naiad, Proteus and Thalassa. An international team of astronomers relying on ground telescopes announced the discovery of five new moons orbiting Neptune in 2003.",
            "Climate Myth... Neptune is warming. In April 2007, Heidi Hammel published a study comparing Neptune's brightening to Earth's warming and solar variations. She concluded that while they don't correlate statistically, the patterns are visually compelling and planetary climate changes may be due to solar variations.",
            "The exploration of Neptune has only begun with one spacecraft, Voyager 2 in 1989. Currently there are no approved future missions to visit the Neptunian system. NASA, ESA and also independent academic groups have proposed future scientific missions to visit Neptune.",

            "As in the case of Uranus, the color is due to methane. Neptune would appear darker than Uranus due to dimmer illumination (greater distance from the Sun). Some of the images of Neptune from the Voyager 2 flyby (in 1989) show a deep blue color, but the colors in those images were enhanced. The actual colors of Uranus and Neptune are quite similar. Pluto (no longer a planet; now classified as a dwarf planet): mostly light brown, with some darker regions."
