        "docs": [
            "Sauron\nSauron's plan would have succeeded had the Elves not detected his influence when he put on the One Ring. It was then the Elves saw him for who he really was, removed their Rings, and did not use them for as long as Sauron retained the One Ring. Enraged, Sauron initiated a great war and conquered much of the land west of Anduin. The Three Rings, however, had been forged by Celebrimbor himself without Sauron's help. These rings were saved and remained in the hands of the Elves, specifically Gil-galad, C\u00edrdan, and Galadriel.",
            "Rings of Power\nThe Three Rings of the Elves were called Narya, the Ring of Fire (set with a ruby); Nenya, the Ring of Water or Ring of Adamant (made of mithril and set with a \"white stone\"), and Vilya, the Ring of Air, the \"mightiest of the Three\" (made of gold and set with a sapphire).[10]",
            "Rings of Power\nDuring the period of The Lord of the Rings, the Three were borne by Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf; but until the end of the book their rings are not seen. Only Frodo, the bearer of the One, sees Galadriel's ring, and only when she draws his attention to it. At the end of the book, these three take their rings, now visible and powerless, over the sea to the Undying Lands.",
            "Rings of Power\nTolkien's The Lord of the Rings is largely concerned with the attempt of Sauron to recover the One and the efforts of the West to forestall him by destroying it. The One is destroyed near the end of the War of the Ring when it falls into the Cracks of Doom in Mount Doom, along with Gollum, who had bitten Frodo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finger off. Tolkien is not entirely clear about what happened to the other rings, though he implied that the power of any that survived came to an end. After the War of the Ring, the three Elven Rings were taken by their bearers over the sea to the Undying Lands.",
            "Rings of Power\nThe Three remained hidden from Sauron and untouched by him. During the Third Age, after he lost the One, they were used for the preservation and enhancement of three remaining realms of the Eldar. Vilya was used by Elrond in Rivendell, Nenya by Galadriel in Lothl\u00f3rien, and Narya by C\u00edrdan in Lindon. When the Istari, or wizards, arrived about T.A.\u00a01100, C\u00edrdan gave Narya to Gandalf, who bore it until the end of the Third Age.",
            "List of Regular Show characters\nQuillgin (voiced by Thomas Haden Church) is an evil elf who resembles a human being and only appears in the \"Regular Show Christmas Special\". He made a magical present that was so powerful that it can give people anything they want and only lava could destroy it. However, as he used dark magic as a key component, it also turns people evil and he got so angry that he tried to use it to end Christmas forever and kill Santa, but it fails when Santa reveals to be wearing a bulletproof vest and steals the present from Quillgin. After Santa, the park gang, and the rival park team up, Mordecai and Rigby attempt to destroy the present by throwing it into the East Pines lava pit. Quillgin fights Mordecai and Rigby for the present while falling in the volcano and was killed after landing into the lava pit with the magical present. The Christmas Special is a parody of the Lord of the Rings, so Quillgin is a parody of Sauron who was originally an elf before his transformation into the Dark Lord.",
            "One Ring\nThe enigmatic Tom Bombadil appeared to be unaffected by the Ring and to have some power over it; when he wore the Ring, it did not make him invisible, and Frodo could not become invisible to him by wearing the Ring. Also, Tom played with the Ring like a conjurer borrowing someone's watch for a trick, seemingly making it disappear and reappear.",
            "Rings of Power\nWhen the Elves wearing the rings discerned Sauron's intention, they immediately removed them and hid them. Sauron invaded the West to recover the rings that the Elves had made; much of the West, including Eregion, was destroyed before he was driven back to Mordor. Sauron recovered the Nine and three of the Seven, but not the Three elven rings, which remained hidden.",
            "One Ring\nThe lines inscribed on the Ring (in boldface above) were pronounced by Sauron when he forged the Ring. The Elven smiths heard him chanting them, and thereupon became aware of his purpose and took off their own Rings to foil his plan.",
            "Rings of Power\nUnlike the other Rings of Power, the One was unadorned. It bore only the inscription of the incantation Sauron spoke when he made it, and even that was invisible unless the ring was heated.[2] Though the other rings could be destroyed in dragon-fire, the One could be unmade only in the unyielding fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.[2]",
            "Three Rings\nThe Three Rings were made by Celebrimbor after Sauron, in the guise of Annatar, had left Eregion. These were free of Sauron's influence, as he did not have a hand in their making. However, they were still forged by Celebrimbor with the arts taught to him by Sauron and thus were still bound to the One Ring. Upon perceiving Sauron's intent, the Elves hid the three from him. They were carried out of Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age, after the destruction of the One Ring.",
            "One Ring\nThough D\u00e9agol and Gandalf had handled the Ring, the only individuals ever to wear it were Sauron, Isildur, Sm\u00e9agol/Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo, Tom Bombadil, and Samwise. None but Bilbo, Frodo, and Samwise are actually called \"Ring-bearers\" in any of Tolkien's works. As Ring-bearers, they were granted passage to the Undying Lands, though Sam lived in the Shire for many years after the departure of Bilbo and Frodo before making the journey himself.",
            "For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls\nThe episode contains several pop culture references. The title of the episode \"For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls\" is a parody of the novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls and the Metallica song inspired by the novel. The action sequence and bloody themes were slightly modeled after the film 300.[3] When Bob Todd is teaching Roger moonshining, Roger jumps over barrels of moonshine, similar to the Donkey Kong video games.[7] Frosty the Snowman appears in Santa's army, which is a reference to the cave-troll scene in Moria from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The elves are wrangling Frosty in with a collar and chains almost exactly like the scene from Fellowship. When Jeff confronts Santa, he stabs him with the polar bear helmet from the film The Golden Compass.[8] When Santa arrives and finds them the song 'Carol of the Bells' by August Burns Red plays.",
            "Rings of Power\nTolkien's essay \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\" in The Silmarillion gives the background of the making of the rings.[1] At the end of the First Age, Sauron evaded the call of the Valar to surrender, and fled to Middle-earth. Midway through the Second Age he came in disguise as Annatar (\"Lord of Gifts\") to the Elven smiths of Eregion, who were led by Celebrimbor, and taught them the craft of forging magic rings. Tolkien writes that the Elves made many lesser rings as essays in the craft,[2] but eventually with Sauron's assistance they forged the Seven and the Nine. The Three were made by Celebrimbor himself without Sauron's assistance; they remained unsullied by his touch.",
            "Rings of Power\nAlso in the Second Age Sauron gave the Seven to various Dwarf-lords (though the Dwarves of Moria maintained a tradition that the ring given to Durin III came directly from the Elven smiths).[8][9] Gandalf mentions a rumour that the seven hoards of the dwarves began each with a single golden ring, and although the Dwarves used their rings to increase their treasure, Tolkien does not explain how the rings accomplished this (save for a reference that the rings \"need gold to breed gold\"). The main power of the Seven on their wearers was to excite their sense of avarice. The wearers did not become invisible, did not get extended life-spans, nor succumb directly to Sauron's control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though he could still influence them to anger and greed.[1]",
            "List of Shrek characters\nSnow White's seven dwarves appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When the place the coffin on the table, Shrek says \"Oh no! Dead girl off the table.\" One of the Dwarfs says \"Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken\" as Shrek finds the Big Bad Wolf in his bed. They are seen again in Shrek 2, when they give Shrek a ring engraved with \"I love you\" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings). In \"Shrek the Third\", one of them (Grumpy) is given to Fiona as a wedding present (as a babysitter) from Snow White who says she has six more at home. They are seen at the end of Scared Shrekless when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them. They have been voiced by various actors including Elisa Gabrielli, David P. Smith, Walt Dohrn, and Sean Bishop. In Shrek The Musical, it is revealed that Grumpy was the father of Lord Ffarquad who kicked him out of his house because he was 28 and living in his basement.",
            "Three Rings\nThe first ring, Narya, was adorned with a red gemstone, perhaps a ruby. It is seen in the final chapter of The Lord of the Rings, along with the other two Elven rings. But unlike them, it is not said what metal Narya was made of.",
            "Three Rings\nWhen Sauron laid waste to Eregion, Vilya was sent to the Elven-king Gil-galad far away in Lindon, where it was later given to Elrond, who bore it through the later years of the Second Age and all of the Third. As Gil-galad was the High King of the Noldor elves at the time of the rings' distribution it was thought that he was best fit to care for the most powerful of the three Elven rings.",
            "Elf (Middle-earth)\nThe \"true names\" remained the first two, though an Elf could be referred to by any of these. Mother-names were usually not used by those who did not know the Elf well. In later history and song any of the four could become the one generally used and recognized.",
            "Talk:Mj\u00f6lnir\nIn the section discussing Mjoelnir's orgins from the Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l, the wording makes it very confusing as to who the sons of Ivaldi are. Are they the two he bets with? The two who made mjoelnir? Both? I forget who the two pairs of dwarves are, but I do believe that it was four distinct dwarves, not two.",
            "Sauron\nIn the First Age (as detailed in The Silmarillion) he was called the \"Lord of Werewolves\" of Tol-in-Gaurhoth. In the Second Age he assumed the name Annatar, which means \"Lord of Gifts\", and Aulendil, meaning \"Friend of Aul\u00c3\u00ab\", as well as Artano, meaning \"High-Smith\", with which he assumed a new identity and tricked the Elves into working with him to create the Rings. In the Third Age he was known for a time as the Necromancer of Dol Guldur because his true identity was still unknown.",
            "The Lord of the Rings: War in the North\nThe eagles drop the trio near Gundabad, and as they climb, they see a massive army of orcs gathering in the valley. Once inside the fortress, they find the bodies of many dwarfs, with a dying dwarf telling them a group of dwarves came to Gundabad to activate a secret weapon with which to destroy the orc army. He tells them that Nordri has the key with which to operate the weapon, and is still alive within the chambers. The trio locate Nordri (Nolan North), who, along with Bruni (Jim Meskimen) is attempting to activate the weapon. The trio assist them, and once the weapon is activated, a horn sounds, the reverberations of which cause the fortress to start collapsing. The dwarves explain the weapon's function is to destroy the entire fortress. However, the Eagles then fly into the chamber, rescuing the trio and the two dwarves, and taking them to the dwarves' home, Nordinbad, a secret mountain stronghold on the edge of Rhovanion.[33] Nordri introduces the trio to his father, Gorin (Ike Amadi), Lord of Nordinbad, who tell them he fears Aganda\u00fbr may be attempting to ally himself with \u00dargost, a Dragon who lives nearby. The trio volunteer to approach \u00dargost and find out.",
            "One Ring\nThe change in the wizard's voice was astounding. Suddenly it became menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the Elves stopped their ears.",
            "Rings of Power\nAlthough the Verse of the Rings describes Three Rings for the Elven-kings, the only Elven king who actually held a ring was Gil-galad. He held both Vilya and Narya, but entrusted them to Elrond and C\u00c3\u00adrdan before perishing in Mordor.",
            "Rings of Power\nThree Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,\nSeven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,\nNine for Mortal Men doomed to die,\nOne for the Dark Lord on his dark throne,\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie,\nOne ring to rule them all, one ring to find them,\nOne ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.",
            "Santa Claus: The Movie\nThe novel also describes how, on a certain long-winter's night, the oldest and wisest elf of all, the Ancient One, foresaw the arrival of a man whose love for children would be equal to that of the elves. The Ancient One believed that this man would be the one to whom the elves would grant full immortality, along with the ability to deliver the elves' gifts to children all over the world.",
            "Fathers of the Dwarves\nThe Dwarves were created in ancient times by Aul\u00eb, one of the Valar. Aul\u00eb was a smith and a craftsman and he wanted to teach his skills to the Dwarves. He made Durin first and then six others. But Eru had intended the Elves to be the Firstborn race so he commanded Aul\u00eb to put the Dwarves to sleep until after the Elves awoke. Eru gave each of the Dwarves their own souls so they could exist as independent beings. At first, when Eru had scolded Aul\u00eb for his creating the Dwarf Fathers, Aul\u00eb was going to destroy them, but Eru stopped him, noting that they now had their own souls. The Dwarves are thereby the \"adopted Children\" of Eru.",
            "Three Rings\nThe ring was wielded by Galadriel of Lothl\u00f3rien, and possessed a radiance that matched that of the stars; while Frodo Baggins could see it by virtue of being a Ring-bearer, Samwise Gamgee tells Galadriel he only \"saw a star through your fingers\". (This appears in many editions as \"finger\"\u2014which sounds more magical, since it suggests that her finger has somehow become transparent\u2014but The Treason of Isengard, ch. 13, note 34, mentions it as an error.)",
            "Middle-earth wars and battles\nThe three commanders agreed to put their disputes with each other on hold in order to face the Goblin threat together. They arranged their forces on the two spurs of the Mountain that lined the valley leading to the now-sealed off great gate, which was the only entrance to the Mountain. The Dwarves and Lake-men formed up on one spur and the Elves on the other, while a light rear-guard lined up across the mouth of the valley to lure the Goblins between the two other armies, and thus envelop them. Bilbo Baggins hid himself with his ring, hoping to avoid the battle.",
            "One Ring\nThe Ring might also have given its wielder the ability to read minds, as Galadriel suggested to Frodo when he wondered why he could not read the thoughts of others as she did.",
            "Rings of Power\nWhen Isildur cut the ring from his hand, Sauron became much weaker. He required the ring to effect his conquest of Middle-earth, and spent most of the Third Age attempting to get it back.",
            "One Ring\nThree Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,\nSeven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,\nNine for Mortal Men doomed to die,\nOne for the Dark Lord on his dark throne\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,\nOne Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.",
            "Three Rings\nWith the ring gone, the magic and beauty of L\u00f3rien also faded along with the extraordinary mallorn trees (save the one that Samwise Gamgee grew in Hobbiton) and it was gradually depopulated, until by the time Arwen came there to die in F.A.\u00a0121 it was deserted and in ruin.",
            "Rings of Power\nSauron intended the rings to subvert these races of Middle-earth to his power, since the One Ring controlled the others. Sauron's plan was not completely successful, for the Elves hid their rings and did not use them while Sauron held the One, and the Dwarves did not respond to the One's control as Sauron expected. But the Men who wore the Nine were enslaved by Sauron, and became the Nazg\u00fbl (\"ringwraiths\").",
            "Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (film)\nA novelization (an oversized children's hardback) of the special was published by Running Press Book Publishers in 2008. The script was adapted by Sierra Harimann with watercolor illustrations based on the original show by Mike Koelsch. There are some additional details in the book, although it is unknown if they are from the imagination of the author or were based on the original script. The Dismal Forest is at the foot of the Mountain of the Whispering Winds. The little girl and boy Kris meets when he arrives are named Annette and Andy. The Sombertown Dungeon was built like a fort with a courtyard in the center, and it is there that the reindeer land to rescue everyone.",
            "One Ring\nFrodo inherited the Ring from his uncle Bilbo Baggins. In Tolkien's earlier novel, The Hobbit, Bilbo found the Ring in the caverns beneath the Misty Mountains. It had been lost in the caverns by Gollum, who used the invisibility it conferred to hunt orcs to eat. Gollum, a hobbit previously known as Sm\u00e9agol, had kept the Ring for hundreds of years. He had murdered his friend D\u00e9agol to get the Ring shortly after D\u00e9agol found it in the river Anduin. Many centuries earlier the Ring had betrayed Isildur and fallen from his finger into the Anduin as he was eluding orcs\u2014who killed him when he became visible. Isildur in turn had cut the Ring from the hand of Sauron, who had made the Ring and let much of his power flow into it. Sauron was the Ring's true master, and the only being who could bend it completely to his will.",
            "One Ring\nIn The Lord of the Rings, Frodo Baggins was appointed Ring-bearer by the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. His task was to carry the One Ring from Rivendell to the Crack of Doom in Mordor and to destroy it before Sauron or his servants could recover it. During this journey, Frodo's companion Samwise Gamgee also carried the ring briefly while Frodo was held captive in the Tower of Cirith Ungol. Near the onset of this journey the Ring was handled also by Tom Bombadil, upon whom the Ring had no apparent effect, and by Gandalf, who cast it into Frodo's fireplace to verify that it was the One Ring.",
            "Ent\nEnts are an old race that appeared in Middle-earth when the Elves did. They were apparently created by Eru Il\u00favatar at the behest of Yavanna: when she learned of Aul\u00eb's children, the Dwarves, she foresaw that they would fell trees, and desired creatures to serve as Shepherds of the Trees to protect the forests from Dwarves and other perils. Although the Ents were sentient beings from the time of their awakening, they did not know how to speak until the Elves taught them.  Treebeard said that the Elves \"cured us of dumbness\", that it was a great gift that could not be forgotten. (\"They always wished to talk to everything, the old Elves did.\")[5] In the Third Age of Middle-earth, the forest of Fangorn was the only place known still to be inhabited by Ents, although the Ent-like Huorns may have survived elsewhere, as in the Old Forest.",
            "Dwarf (Middle-earth)\nSome time after the Elves had awakened at Cuivi\u00e9nen, the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves were released from their stone chambers. The eldest of them, called Durin, wandered until he founded the city of Khazad-d\u00fbm in the natural caves beneath three peaks: Caradhras, Celebdil, and Fanuidhol (known in Khuzdul as Baranzinbar, Zirakzigil, and Bundushath\u00fbr, respectively). The city, populated by the Longbeards or Durin's folk, grew and prospered continuously through Durin's life (which was so long that he was called Durin the Deathless, also a reference to the belief by his people that he would be reincarnated seven times). It was the only one of the Dwarf mansions to survive the First Age.",
            "Samwise Gamgee\nWhen the Fellowship was split up at the Falls of Rauros, Sam insisted on accompanying Frodo. Sam protected and cared for Frodo, who was growing weaker under the Ring's influence, as they moved through the dangerous lands toward Mordor. Sam distrusted Gollum, who became their guide into Mordor. His suspicions were proven right when Gollum betrayed them to the giant spider Shelob. After Shelob apparently killed Frodo, Sam drove her off. When a band of orcs approached, Sam was forced to leave the apparently dead Frodo and take the Ring himself, and briefly became a Ring-bearer. He was momentarily tempted by its promise of power, but did not succumb to it, subsequently rescuing Frodo (who had only been paralysed) from the Orcs who held him captive. Sam also returned the Ring to Frodo, making him the only Ring-bearer to freely give up the Ring without intervention. The two then journeyed alone through Mordor and into the heart of Mount Doom, where Gollum attacked Frodo and reclaimed the Ring, only to inadvertently destroy both it and himself by falling into the mountain's lava.",

After he destroyed the two lamps that illuminated the world, the Valar moved to Aman, a continent to the west of Middle-earth, where they established their home called Valinor. Yavanna created Two Trees that illuminated Valinor and left Middle-earth to darkness and Melkor. Soon after, stars created by Varda began to shine and the Elves awoke. The elves originally formed three groups: the Vanyar, the Noldor, and the Teleri, though some elves were captured and enslaved by Melkor, eventually to be bred into orcs. Knowing the danger the Elves were in, the Valar decided to fight Melkor to keep the Elves safe. After defeating and capturing Melkor, they invited the Elves to live in Aman. Many Elves travelled to Aman, while others refused and still others stopped along the way, including the Elves who later became the Sindar, ruled by the Elf King Thingol and Melian, a Maia. Of the three tribes that set out, all of the Vanyar and Noldor, and many of the Teleri reached Aman.",

When it was decided that the Ring had to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteered to accompany Frodo\u2014now the Ring-bearer\u2014in his quest.

They thought instead that it might have been lost when Thr\u00f3r was killed by Azog in Moria.[5] One of the motivations for Balin's doomed expedition to Moria was the possibility of recovering the ring.

Elves that remained in Middle-earth were doomed to a slow decline until, in the words of Galadriel, they faded and became a \"rustic folk of dell and cave,\" and were greatly diminished from their ancient power and nobility.

When Sauron put on the One Ring, Celebrimbor, Lord of Eregion, realised that the Elves had been betrayed and revolted against the Dark Lord's influence. With his disguise uncovered, Sauron then demanded that all of the great rings in Eregion be surrendered to him, as all of them were made with Sauron's counsel, except the Three Rings of the Elves.

As in the final story, he was described as a man who cut the One Ring from the finger of Sauron after his father (here named Orendil) defeated Sauron in single combat, then lost it while swimming across a river to escape Orcs.[3]:261",

There are many different clans of Elves, but the main distinction is between the Calaquendi or Light Elves and the Moriquendi or Dark Elves. Tolkien's work The Silmarillion tells of how the Valar came to Middle-earth shortly after the awakening of the Elves, and invited them to come and live with them in their home in the land of Aman. Those elves who accepted and began the Great Journey to Aman from their birthplace of Cuivi\u00e9nen were called the Eldar or the Middle-earth Eldar. The elves who completed the journey were sometimes called the Light Elves because they saw the magical Light of the Two Trees, the source of light in Aman. Those elves who refused the offer were called the Avari, and the Eldar who tired of the long journey west and remained behind in Middle-earth were called the Dark Elves because they would never see the Light of the Two Trees. Generally Dark Elves were considered less powerful than Light Elves, but the term 'Dark' did not imply they were in any way evil. In later years some of the Light Elves (chiefly the Noldor clan) returned to Middle-earth, mainly on a quest to retrieve precious jewels called the Silmarils, stolen from them by Morgoth.",

The First Age is dominated by the doomed quest of the elf F\u00ebanor and most of his Noldorin clan to recover three precious jewels called the Silmarils that Morgoth stole from them (hence the title The Silmarillion). The Second and Third Age are dominated by the forging of the Rings of Power, and the fate of the One Ring forged by Sauron, which gives its wearer the power to control or influence those wearing the other Rings of Power (hence the title The Lord of the Rings).",
            "Rings of Power\nThe ring had a great effect on the human bearers who held it in the interim. It granted them indefinite life; though the effort of living became more difficult as time went on, for it did not grant new life.[2] If they wore it, it made them invisible, enhanced their hearing, and made the shadowy world of the wraiths visible to them. It exerted a malicious influence; Gandalf mentions that though a bearer might begin with good intentions, the good intentions would not last.[2] The Ring would give its bearer a fraction of Sauron's power, proportionate with the bearer's strength and force of will. Gollum, Bilbo, Sam, and Frodo only became invisible, although when Frodo bound Gollum to his service in The Two Towers, he indicated that he could use the Ring to control Gollum (because the Ring had mastered Gollum long ago). Gandalf and Galadriel, however, recognized that they could use the full power of the Ring, becoming even more powerful than Sauron himself, but they resisted, knowing that in the end, the Ring would corrupt them. Gandalf explained to Frodo that, with great concentration and training, even he could tap into the Ring's power, but probably at the cost of his sanity.",
            "Glorfindel\nThe problem lay in Tolkien's conception of the spirits of dead Elves being re-embodied in their old bodies after a Purgatory-like period in the Halls of Mandos in Valinor, the home of Tolkien's \"gods\", the Valar and Maiar, where Elves previously lived before (re)migrating to Middle-earth. After being re-embodied, previously dead Elves stayed in Valinor. Tolkien decided that each Elf's name should be unique, and therefore the two Glorfindels should be one and the same.",

Yet the Elf C\u00edrdan who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the elven Ring of power called Narya, the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort.

Its power of healing may be particularly strong, as Elrond seems to be the greatest healer in Middle-Earth at the time of the Quest.[3] There is some speculation that the ring controlled minor elements, considering the event where Elrond had summoned a torrent of water as the Nazg\u00fbl attempted to capture Frodo and the One Ring.",

They could walk, if they would, unseen by all eyes in this world beneath the sun, and they could see things in worlds invisible to mortal men; but too often they beheld only the phantoms and delusions of Sauron. And one by one, sooner or later, according to their native strength and to the good or evil of their wills in the beginning, they fell under the thraldom of the ring that they bore and of the domination of the One which was Sauron's. And they became forever invisible save to him that wore the Ruling Ring, and they entered into the realm of shadows.

No Dwarves of these lines appear in the tales; however, as noted below, the Longbeards may be formed out of Dwarves from all lines, and Dwarves from Durin's Folk may therefore have ancestors from these other lines.

Nolan's argument was that the major difference between various political philosophies, the real defining element in what a person believes politically, is the amount of government control over human action that is advocated.[citation needed] Nolan further reasoned that virtually all human political action can be divided into two broad categories: economic and personal. The \"economic\" category includes what people do as producers and consumers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what they can buy, sell and produce, where they work, who they hire and what they do with their money. Examples of economic activity include starting or operating a business, buying a home, constructing a building and working in an office. The \"personal\" category includes what people do in relationships, in self-expression and what they do with their own bodies and minds. Examples of personal activities include whom they marry; choosing what books they read and movies they watch; what foods, medicines and drugs they choose to consume; recreational activities; religious choices; organizations they join; and with whom they choose to associate.",
            "Economic system\nAn economic system is a system of production, resource allocation, and distribution of goods and services within a society or a given geographic area. It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision-making processes, and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a given community. As such, an economic system is a type of social system. The mode of production is a related concept.[1] All economic systems have three basic questions to ask: what to produce, how to produce and in what quantities, and who receives the output of production.",
            "Economic system\nThere are multiple components to economic system.Decision-making structures of an economy determine the use of economic inputs (the factors of production), distribution of output, the level of centralization in decision-making, and who makes these decisions. Decisions might be carried out by industrial councils, by a government agency, or by private owners.",
            "Market economy\nA market economy is an economic system where decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand,[1] which determines the prices of goods and services.[2] The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions, or the allocation of producer good, are primarily made through capital and financial markets.[3] This is contrasted with a planned economy, where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated plan of production established by a state or other organizational body that controls the factors of production.",
            "Economic problem\n'To whom and how will you distribute the goods?' and 'For whom will you produce this for?' arises from this question. This question deals with distributing goods that have been produced, focusing on efficiency and equity.",
            "Economics\nThe continuous interplay (exchange or trade) done by economic actors in all markets sets the prices for all goods and services which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, as well as the remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent).[h] Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.[i]",

            "Production function\nEconomic well-being also increases due to the growth of incomes that are gained from the growing and more efficient market production. Market production is the only one production form which creates and distributes incomes to stakeholders. Public production and household production are financed by the incomes generated in market production. Thus market production has a double role in creating well-being, i.e. the role of producing developing commodities and the role to creating income. Because of this double role market production is the \u201cprimus motor\u201d of economic well-being and therefore here under review.",
            "Monopoly\nThe boundaries of what constitutes a market and what does not are relevant distinctions to make in economic analysis. In a general equilibrium context, a good is a specific concept including geographical and time-related characteristics (\"grapes sold during October 2009 in Moscow\" is a different good from \"grapes sold during October 2009 in New York\"). Most studies of market structure relax a little their definition of a good, allowing for more flexibility in the identification of substitute goods.",
            "Economic system\nThere are several basic questions that must be answered in order for an economy to run satisfactorily. The scarcity problem, for example, requires answers to basic questions, such as: what to produce, how to produce it, and who gets what is produced. An economic system is a way of answering these basic questions, and different economic systems answer them differently. Many different objectives may be seen as desirable for an economy, like efficiency, growth, liberty, and equality.[9]",

            "Logrolling\nHuman beings, whether ignorant or informed, rational or irrational, logical or illogical, determine individual and group action through choices. Economics studies these choices, including the choice to logroll, and their particular influence within the market sector (Schwartz 1977[10]). In America, political and economic decisions are usually made by politicians elected to legislative assemblies, and not directly by the citizenry (Buchanan and Tullock 1962[2]). Although legislative votes are recorded and are available to the American public, legislators can exchange their votes on issues they do not care much about for votes on other issues that are more important to their personal agendas (Holcombe 2006[4]). In The Calculus of Consent, James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock explore the relationship between individual choice in the voting process and in the marketplace, specifically within logrolling. Logrolling vote trades, like any activity within the marketplace, must be mutually beneficial (Buchanan and Tullock 1962[2]).",

There are different types of customer markets including consumer markets, business markets, government markets, Globalization international markets, and reseller markets. The consumer market is made up of individuals who buy goods and services for their own personal use or use in their household. Business markets include those that buy goods and services for use in producing their own products to sell. This is different from the reseller market which includes businesses that purchase goods to resell as is for a profit. These are the same companies mentioned as market intermediaries. The government market consists of government agencies that buy goods to produce public services or transfer goods to others who need them.

            "Production\u2013possibility frontier\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, the PPF illustrates the production possibilities available to a nation or economy during a given period of time for broad categories of output. It is traditionally used to show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the y-axis versus investment on the x-axis. However, an economy may achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient. Market failure (such as imperfect competition or externalities) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition) may lead to the wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods) compared to what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF.[19]",

This failure of government is seen as the result of the inherent problems of democracy and other forms of government perceived by this school and also of the power of special-interest groups (rent seekers) both in the private sector and in the government bureaucracy. Conditions that many would regard as negative are often seen as an effect of subversion of the free market by coercive government intervention. Beyond philosophical objections, a further issue is the practical difficulty that any single decision maker may face in trying to understand (and perhaps predict) the numerous interactions that occur between producers and consumers in any market.",

Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of these command economies. For example, Leon Trotsky believed that those at the top of the chain of command, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and therefore would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.[13]",

Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities. For example, in some predominately market-oriented and mixed economies, the state utilizes economic planning in strategic industries such as the aerospace industry.

The reason for this is that self-interest drives actors to beneficial behavior in a case of serendipity. Efficient methods of production are adopted to maximize profits. Low prices are charged to maximize revenue through gain in market share by undercutting competitors.[citation needed] Investors invest in those industries most urgently needed to maximize returns, and withdraw capital from those less efficient in creating value.

An economist is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a degree in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by Lionel Robbins in 1932, is \"the science which studies human behavior as a relation between scarce means having alternative uses\". Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no economic problem. Briefer yet is \"the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants\" and \"the study of the financial aspects of human behavior\".",

Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed.

It was first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Friedrich Hayek.[4][8] The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources rationally in an economy. The free market relies on the price mechanism, wherein people individually have the ability to decide how resources should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for specific goods or services. The price conveys embedded information about the abundance of resources as well as their desirability which in turn allows, on the basis of individual consensual decisions, corrections that prevent shortages and surpluses; Mises and Hayek argued that this is the only possible solution, and without the information provided by market prices, socialism lacks a method to rationally allocate resources. Those who agree with this criticism argue it is a refutation of socialism and that it shows that a socialist planned economy could never work. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by economic historians as the Socialist Calculation Debate.[9]",

By that time \"Hal had already come up with the lyrics to 'I'll Never Fall in Love Again,' and my hospital stay had inspired him to write, 'What do you get when you kiss a girl? / You get enough germs to catch pneumonia / After you do, she'll never phone you.'\"[5] When he finally sat with the lyrics in front of him, he recalls, \"I wrote the melody for 'I'll Never Fall in Love Again' faster than I had ever written any song in my life.\"[4] The surge of creativity paid off. \"We came in with the song the next morning, and it went into the show a couple of nights later. 'I'll Never Fall in Love Again' became the outstanding hit from the score and pretty much stopped the show every night.\"[4] Promises, Promises had its Broadway premiere on December 1 of that year,[6] and the song was originally performed as a duet between the characters played by Jill O'Hara and Jerry Orbach as they ruminate on the various troubles that falling in love brings.

While reporting for a recording session, Garrett thought that she was summoned to do overdubs for a song she'd co-written titled \"Man in the Mirror.\" Instead she was surprised to learn that she'd been chosen to sing a duet with Jackson.[3] To some, the wispy ballad was reminiscent of Jackson's Motown classic \"Got to Be There.\"[3]",

The judge asked him if he had learned anything, to which he replied, \"I learned, Your Honor, that you can't make a woman love you if she don't.\"[7] Raitt recorded the vocal in just one take in the studio, later saying that it was so sad a song that she could not recapture the emotion: \"We'd try to do it again and I just said, 'You know, this ain't going to happen.'\"[8]",

The vocal range of the melody extends from the note F\u266f3 to A4.[26] Sandy Masuo of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote, \"These songs [\"I Could Fall in Love\", \"I'm Getting Used to You\" and \"Captive Heart\"] were to be her armaments in the crossover war and, sure enough, they're catchy, state-of-the-art pop/R&B\u00a0\u2013 but, despite the sublime melody of \"I Could Fall in Love\", strikingly anonymous.\"[27] An editor from the Contra Costa Times called the song a \"jazzy ballad\".[28] Donny Brusca's book BPM List 2006: Main Edition classified it as \"light-adult contemporary\".[29] Andrew Griffin of The Town Talk called it a \"Tex-Mex (Texas-Mexico) pop\" song.[30]"

            "I Walk the Line\n\"I Walk the Line\" is a song written and recorded in 1956 by Johnny Cash. After three attempts with moderate chart ratings, it became Cash's first number one hit on the Billboard charts. It reached number 17 on the US pop charts. It remained on the record charts for over 43 weeks, and sold over 2 million copies.[4] It has also been used on many LP's released from Sun Records, such as With His Hot and Blue Guitar, Sings the Songs That Made Him Famous, and Sings Hank Williams. It was the title song for a 1970 film starring Gregory Peck.",
            "I Walk the Line\nThe unique chord progression for the song was inspired by backwards playback of guitar runs on Cash's tape recorder[5] while he was in the Air Force stationed in Germany. Later in a telephone interview, Cash stated, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wrote the song backstage one night in 1956 in Gladewater, Texas. I was newly married at the time, and I suppose I was laying out my pledge of devotion.\"[6] After the writing of the song Cash had a discussion with fellow performer [Carl Perkins] who encouraged him to adopt \"I Walk the Line\" as the song title. Cash originally intended the song as a slow ballad, but producer Sam Phillips preferred a faster arrangement,[7] which Cash grew to like as the uptempo recording met with success.",
            "I Walk the Line (film)\nIn an interview published in October 2009, Madison Jones, the author upon whose novel the film's screenplay was based, said Peck \"didn\u2019t really fit the role.... He didn\u2019t really fit any role unless he is playing himself.\" According to Jones, \"Peck himself said there was a good movie lying on the cutting-room floor.\"[4]",
            "I Walk the Line\nThe song was originally recorded at Sun Studio on April 2, 1956, and was released on May 1. It spent six weeks at the top spot on the U.S. country Juke Box charts that summer, one week on the C&W Jockey charts and number two on the C&W Best Seller charts.[9] \"I Walk the Line\" crossed over and reached number 19 on the pop music charts.[10]",
            "I Can Dream About You\nThe song first appeared in Streets of Fire, where it was performed by the fictional group The Sorels. The real voice behind the version used in the film was Winston Ford, but Hartman's version was the one used on the soundtrack album and released as a single.[2] In a Songfacts interview with the film's musical director, Kenny Vance, he recalled \"The same guy that sings lead on that and \"Countdown to Love,\" a song that I wrote for the film, was a guy working at a Radio Shack (Winston Ford), and I think when you look at the film and The Sorels are singing it live in the movie, that was the version that was supposed to come out, and I recorded that version. But then when Dan Hartman heard it, I don't know what happened next, but I know that he took that guy's voice off and he put his own on, and he had a hit with it. Hollywood is a very slippery place.\"[2][3]",
            "I Walk the Line (film)\nCash re-recorded the title song for the film, and ended up with enough material for a soundtrack album. One of the songs, \"Flesh and Blood,\" even became a number one country hit in 1971.[1] The soundtrack featured three songs not heard in the film (\"This Town\", \"Face of Despair\" and \"The World's gonna Fall On You\").",

When Sony released it on DVD in 2006, the final shot was altered to show a freeze-frame of Peck's face. In the original version, Peck's face is never frozen, and his eyes are open.",
            "Walk the Line\nCritics generally responded with positive reviews, garnering an 82% on Rotten Tomatoes. The two lead performances received rave reviews, particularly Witherspoon's, whose performance is described by critics as her best work to date. Roger Ebert praised Witherspoon for her \"boundless energy\" and predicted her to win the Academy Award for Best Actress.[6][7] In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano wrote, \"Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do first-rate work \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they sing, they twang, they play new-to-them instruments, they crackle with wit and charisma, and they give off so much sexual heat it's a wonder they don't burst into flames\".[8]",

Scott, in his review for The New York Times, had problems with Phoenix's performance: \"Even though his singing voice doesn't match the original - how could it? - he is most convincing in concert, when his shoulders tighten and he cocks his head to one side. Otherwise, he seems stuck in the kind of off-the-rack psychological straitjacket in which Hollywood likes to confine troubled geniuses\".[9] In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, \"A lot of credit for Phoenix's performance has to go to Mangold, who has always been good at finding the bleak melodrama in taciturn souls ... If Mangold's new movie has a problem, it's that he and co-screenwriter Gill Dennis sometimes walk the lines of the inspirational biography too rigorously\".[10]",

The song was first performed by his younger brother, Frank, who had a small role in the original Rocky as a singer at a street corner, and then bit parts in several of the sequels. For Rhinestone (1984), Stallone sang (albeit, very badly) such songs as \"Drinkenstein\" as well as duets with his co-star, and actual country music star, Dolly Parton.[61] He also performed two songs when he guest-starred on The Muppet Show in the 1980s, at the height of his career.[62] The last time Stallone sang in a film was in Grudge Match (2013) when he and Robert De Niro performed \"The Star Spangled Banner\" together.[63] Stallone's brother Frank achieved moderate success as a pop singer, releasing the #10 U.S. hit \"Far From Over\" in 1983 for the film Staying Alive, which Stallone directed and had a cameo appearance in.

Another of Denise's big musical moments occurs in the studio to sing tracks for \"God Give Me Strength,\" an expensively produced single that fails to generate excitement on the charts, alluding to Spector's recording of \"River Deep, Mountain High\" for Tina Turner (written by Spector, Greenwich and Barry). Singer Elvis Costello, who co-wrote \"God Give Me Strength\" (with Burt Bacharach) for the film, also wrote \"Unwanted Number,\" which, in the movie, is crafted by Denise and Cazsatt for The Luminaries and causes a scandal because it tells in a sympathetic manner the story of an unmarried pregnant preteen.",

So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like...\" After filming Selena, Lopez was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\" and cut a demo in Spanish.[5] Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled \"Vivir Sin Ti\", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Records, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead.[6] She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the On the 6, Lopez was aware of the fact that she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent.[7] Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career.

Michael Walls, who was credited as stylist on Ritual of Love, worked with  White on the look for the Ritual of Love album sleeve, and three of the music videos released for the album. Walls had the idea for the Chanel inspired pearls and black dress used on the album cover, the french maid look and multiple wardrobe changes for video of \"The Way I Feel About You\", and the \"Walkin' the Dog\" video, which was based on a scene from the film Sweet Charity.",

            "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\nLorraine Crosby, a singer from England, was the guest singer, though AllMusic incorrectly attributes the female vocals to Ellen Foley.[11] Crosby and her partner Stuart Emerson had moved to Los Angeles to work with Steinman, who became their manager. He secured them a contract with Meat Loaf's label MCA. While visiting the company's studios on Sunset Boulevard, Crosby was asked to provide guide vocals for Meat Loaf, who was recording \"I'd Do Anything for Love\". Crosby recalls, \"In I went and sang it twice and I never thought anything more of it until six months later when I got a phone call saying, 'Would you mind if we used your vocals?'\" As Crosby had recorded her part as guide vocals, she received no royalties from the song.[13]",

When the new version was coming together, Rosenman approached her to play the girls' mother. She has two musical numbers in the film and on the soundtrack. Rosenman plans to team with director Joel Schumacher, one of the screenwriters of the original 1976 movie, to add five new songs to those by Curtis Mayfield (in the original) and R. Kelly (in the 2012 version) for a Broadway musical of Sparkle.[17]",

In 1955, they began recording under the Sun label.",

During this live performance, one of the prisoners in the background was laughing, and Cash started to chuckle. He gently admonished the man, \"No laughing during the song, please!\" The man yelled something about \"Hell!\" and Cash answered, \"I know, 'hell'!\" When he finished the song, Cash made a comment that was largely repeated, somewhat out of context, by Joaquin Phoenix in the 2005 film Walk the Line: \"I just wanted to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album released on Columbia Records, so you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that.\"[1]",
            "Line dance\nBilly Ray Cyrus' 1992 hit \"Achy Breaky Heart\" helped catapult western line dancing into the mainstream public consciousness.[3] In 1994 choreographer Max Perry had a worldwide dance hit[citation needed] with \"Swamp Thang\" for the song \"Swamp Thing\" by The Grid. This was a techno song that fused banjo sounds in the melody line and helped to start a trend of dancing to forms of music other than country. In this mid 1990s period country western music was influenced by the popularity of line dancing. This influence was so great that Chet Atkins was quoted as saying \"The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.\"[21]",
            "I Walk the Line\nWhen performing this song on record, and in later live and television appearances, Cash would place a piece of paper under the strings of his guitar towards the tuning end.

Some of these online platforms offer Direct Mutual Funds which are cheaper than buying regular mutual funds from traditional distributors. The difference in expense ratio of a regular plan and direct plan is the commissions paid to the distributors.

            "Investment banking\nOn behalf of the bank and its clients, a large investment bank's primary function is buying and selling products.[citation needed] In market making, traders will buy and sell financial products with the goal of making money on each trade. Sales is the term for the investment bank's sales force, whose primary job is to call on institutional and high-net-worth investors to suggest trading ideas (on a caveat emptor basis) and take orders. Sales desks then communicate their clients' orders to the appropriate trading rooms, which can price and execute trades, or structure new products that fit a specific need. Structuring has been a relatively recent activity as derivatives have come into play, with highly technical and numerate employees working on creating complex structured products which typically offer much greater margins and returns than underlying cash securities. In 2010, investment banks came under pressure as a result of selling complex derivatives contracts to local municipalities in Europe and the US.[8] Strategists advise external as well as internal clients on the strategies that can be adopted in various markets. Ranging from derivatives to specific industries, strategists place companies and industries in a quantitative framework with full consideration of the macroeconomic scene. This strategy often affects the way the firm will operate in the market, the direction it would like to take in terms of its proprietary and flow positions, the suggestions salespersons give to clients, as well as the way structurers create new products. Banks also undertake risk through proprietary trading, performed by a special set of traders who do not interface with clients and through \"principal risk\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201drisk undertaken by a trader after he buys or sells a product to a client and does not hedge his total exposure.

[19] The participating dividend may be used to decrease premiums, or to increase the cash value of the policy. [20] Some life policies pay nonparticipating dividends. As a contrasting example, in the United Kingdom, the surrender value of a with-profits policy is increased by a bonus, which also serves the purpose of distributing profits.

The returns may be higher than fixed instruments such as CDs, money market accounts, and bonds but not as high as market returns. Equity Index Annuities are insured by each State's Guarantee Fund; coverage is not as strong as the insurance provided by the FDIC.

            "United Kingdom company law\nWhile shareholders have a privileged position in UK corporate governance, most are themselves institutions - mainly asset managers - holding \"other people's money\" from pension funds, life insurance policies and mutual funds.[131] Shareholding institutions, who are entered on the share registers of public companies on the London Stock Exchange, are mainly asset managers and they infrequently exercise their governance rights.[132] In turn, asset managers take money from other institutional investors, particularly pension funds, mutual funds and insurance funds, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through pensions, are beneficiaries from the returns on shares. Historically institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. Under the Pensions Act 2004 sections 241 to 243 require that pension fund trustees are elected or appointed to be accountable to the beneficiaries of the fund, while the Companies Act 2006 section 168 ensures that directors are accountable to shareholders. However, the rules of contract, equity and fiduciary duty that operate between asset managers and the real capital investors have not been codified. Government reports have suggested,[133] and case law requires,[134] that asset managers follow the instructions about voting rights from investors in pooled funds according to the proportion of their investment, and follow instructions entirely when investors have separate accounts.[135] Some institutional investors have been found to work \"behind the scenes\" to achieve corporate governance objectives through informal but direct communication with management,[136] although an increasing concern has developed since the global financial crisis that asset managers and all financial intermediaries face structural conflicts of interest and should be banned from voting on other people's money entirely.[137] Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and institutional investor ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other people's money, are bound by fiduciary obligations, deriving from the law of trusts and obligations to exercise care deriving from the common law. The Stewardship Code 2010, drafted by the Financial Reporting Council (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting.

Most episodes included fairly long dialogue-free sequences showing the team members\u2014particularly electronics expert Barney Collier\u2014making technical preparations for the mission, usually to the accompaniment of another easily recognizable tune called \"The Plot.\" Lalo Schifrin also wrote a theme piece for each main character and the sound track for each episode incorporated variations of these throughout.

Muslim names or titles like asad and ghadanfar (Arabic for lion), shir and arslan (Persian and Turkish for lion, respectively) are common in the Muslim world. Prominent Muslims with animal names include: Hamzah, Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Al-Azdi (called \"Abu Hurairah\", the Father of the kitten), Abdul-Qadir Gilani (called al-baz al-ashhab, the white falcon) and Lal Shahbaz Qalander of Sehwan (called \"red falcon\").[75]",

So after describing an animal's \"muddy trail\" and \"curly tail,\" Dylan sings that \"he wasn't too small and he wasn't too big\" and so that animal was named a pig.[4] Similarly, the cow got its name because Adam \"saw milk comin' out but he didn't know how\" and the bear got its name because it has a \"great big furry back and furry hair.\"[4]",

            "Zoology\nFurther, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:\nDomain; kingdom; phylum; class; order; family; genus; species. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.[16]",
            "Genus\nThe rules for the scientific names of organisms are laid down in the Nomenclature Codes, which are employed by the speakers of all languages, giving each species a single unique Latinate name. The standard way of scientifically describing species and other lower-ranked taxa is by binomial nomenclature. The generic name forms its first half. For example, the gray wolf's binomial name is Canis lupus, with Canis (Lat. \"dog\") being the generic name shared by the wolf's close relatives and lupus (Lat. \"wolf\") being the specific name particular to the wolf. The specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by subspecies names in zoology or a variety of infraspecific names in botany. Especially with these longer names, when the generic name is known from context, it is typically shortened to its initial letter.",

As the great prince wanders uphill, he discovers the human hunter named \"Man\" by all the animals is coming and rushes down to the meadow to get everyone to safety. Bambi is briefly separated from his mother during that scene but is escorted to her by the Great Prince as the three of them make it back in the forest just as Man fires his gun.",
            "Phoenician language\nPerhaps the most interesting case of Punic influence is that of the name of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising Portugal and Spain), which, according to one theory among many, derived from the Punic I-Shaphan meaning \"coast of hyraxes\", in turn a misidentification on the part of Phoenician explorers of its numerous rabbits as hyraxes.[citation needed] Another case is the name of a tribe of hostile \"hairy people\" that Hanno the Navigator found in the Gulf of Guinea. The name given to these people by Hanno the Navigator's interpreters was transmitted from Punic into Greek as gorillai and was applied in 1847 by Thomas S. Savage to the western gorilla.",

Biologic species and celestial bodies are frequently named for their discoverers.[8] Alternatively, their discoverers may name them in honor of others.[9]  Occasionally, material goods, such as toys or garments, may be named for persons closely associated with them in the public mind.  The teddy bear, for example, was named for President Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt, because of a popular story in which the then-President objected to cruel treatment of a bear by hunters.[10]",
            "Grammatical gender\nIn the case of languages which have masculine and feminine genders, the relation between biological sex and grammatical gender tends to be less exact in the case of animals than in the case of people. In Spanish, for instance, a cheetah is always un guepardo (masculine) and a zebra is always una cebra (feminine), regardless of their biological sex. To specify the sex of an animal, an adjective may be added, as in un guepardo hembra (\"a female cheetah\"), or una cebra macho (\"a male zebra\"). Different names for the male and the female of a species are more frequent for common pets or farm animals, e.g. English cow and bull, Spanish vaca \"cow\" and toro \"bull\".",

Barnum's Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan & Hippodrome,\" a traveling circus, menagerie and museum of \"freaks.\" It went through various names: \"P.T. Barnum's Travelling World's Fair, Great Roman Hippodrome and Greatest Show On Earth,\" and after an 1881 merger with James Bailey and James L. Hutchinson, \"P.T. Barnum's Greatest Show On Earth, And The Great London Circus, Sanger's Royal British Menagerie and The Grand International Allied Shows United,\" soon shortened to \"Barnum & Bailey's.\" This entertainment phenomenon was the first circus to display three rings,[25] which made it the largest circus the world had ever seen.[citation needed] The show's first primary attraction was Jumbo, an African elephant he purchased in 1882 from the London Zoo.

He mates and has a litter with a tigress, and raises a litter until one day he finds that hunters have captured and killed his entire family. He exacts revenge by attacking and eating the cattle and livestock of nearby villages, but is captured by poachers. He is sent to a circus in Malgudi, where a harsh animal trainer known only as \"the Captain\" starves him and forces him to do tricks in the circus. He lives in captivity successfully for some time, but eventually his wild instincts overcome him and he mauls and kills the Captain. After an extended rampage though town, he is recaptured, but this time voluntarily by a monk/renunciant with whom he befriends and finds peace on the hills. The monk, called the Master, later realizing his own days are coming to an end, donates the elderly tiger to the local zoo, where he is cared for, admired by onlookers, and passes his days.",

            "Zootopia\nDevelopment of the film that would come to be called Zootopia began when Byron Howard pitched six story ideas to Disney Animation chief creative officer and executive producer John Lasseter, of which three involved animal characters: an all-animal adaptation of The Three Musketeers, a 1960s-themed story about a \"mad doctor cat...who turned children into animals,\" and a \"bounty hunter pug in space.\"[38] The common thread running through these ideas was that Howard wanted to do a film similar to Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Robin Hood, which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles.[39] According to Howard, Zootopia emerged from his desire to create something different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. His concept, in which animals live in a modern world designed by animals for animals, was well received by Lasseter, who responded by embracing and lifting Howard \"in the air like a baby Simba.\"[40] Lasseter suggested that Howard should try combining the 1960s theme with the animal characters, especially the space pug.[38] This led Howard to develop and pitch Savage Seas, an international spy film centered on an arctic hare named \"Jack Savage\" who was somewhat like James Bond.[38][41] It was around this time that screenwriter Jared Bush was hired to work on the film; he was excited to work on a spy film because his own father and grandfather had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.[38]",

Some animals were considered divine e.g.:dolphins. The 21st-century debates about animals can be traced back to the ancient world, and the idea of a divine hierarchy. In the Book of Genesis 1:26 (5th or 6th century BCE), Adam is given \"dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\" Dominion need not entail property rights, but it has been interpreted, by some, over the centuries to imply ownership.[11]",

This name is Latin for \"first elephant\". Cuvier coined the name Elephas mammonteus a few months later, but the former name was subsequently used.[7] In 1828, the British naturalist Joshua Brookes used the name Mammuthus borealis for woolly mammoth fossils in his collection that he put up for sale, thereby coining a new genus name.[8] It is unclear where and how the word \"mammoth\" originated. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it comes from an old Vogul word m\u0113mo\u014bt 'earth-horn'.[9] It may be a version of mehemot, the Arabic version of the biblical word \"behemoth\". Another possible origin is Estonian, where maa means earth, and mutt means mole. The word was first used in Europe during the early 17th century, when referring to maimanto tusks discovered in Siberia.[10] The American president Thomas Jefferson, who had a keen interest in palaeontology, was partially responsible for transforming the word mammoth from a noun describing the prehistoric elephant to an adjective describing anything of surprisingly large size. The first recorded use of the word as an adjective was in a description of a wheel of cheese (the \"Cheshire Mammoth Cheese\") given to Jefferson in 1802.[11]",

            "Anthropomorphism\nAnd there is another charm about him, namely, that he puts animals in a pleasing light and makes them interesting to mankind. For after being brought up from childhood with these stories, and after being as it were nursed by them from babyhood, we acquire certain opinions of the several animals and think of some of them as royal animals, of others as silly, of others as witty, and others as innocent.",
            "American bison\nThe term buffalo is sometimes considered to be a misnomer for this animal, and could be confused with \"true\" buffalos, the Asian water buffalo and the African buffalo. However, bison is a Greek word meaning ox-like animal, while buffalo originated with the French fur trappers who called these massive beasts b\u0153ufs, meaning ox or bullock\u2014so both names, bison and buffalo, have a similar meaning. The name buffalo is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison. Samuel de Champlain applied the term buffalo (buffles in French) to the bison in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the Nipissing First Nation, who said they travelled forty days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals.[11] In English usage, the term buffalo dates to 1625 in North America, when the term was first recorded for the American mammal.[12]  It thus has a much longer history than the term bison, which was first recorded in 1774.[13] The American bison is very closely related to the wisent or European bison.",
            "Land of Oz\nIn Oz, animals such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger can talk, and all native animals appear to be capable of speech. Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West emphasized the difference between Animals and animals. Animals (capitalized) are sentient beings that can talk. Several theories exist as to how animals gained the gift of speech."

            "Be Like Mike\nPitzel wrote the lyrics to \"Be Like Mike\" inspired by The Jungle Book song, and put it to a tune by Ira Antelis and Steve Shafer.[3] \"If we had used music from The Jungle Book,\" Antelis told journalist Darren Rovell, \"the advertisement would have been forgotten.\"[1]",
            "You'll Be in My Heart\nCollins was originally hired by Disney as a songwriter, but given his history as a drummer for the rock band Genesis, he appealed to the Disney production crew, who \"wanted a strong jungle beat to accompany Tarzan's adventures\".[3] This \"ballad\" is one of five original songs he wrote for the film, and he ended up also performing this song as well.[4]",
            "The Jungle Book (2016 film)\nThe musical score for The Jungle Book was composed and conducted by frequent Favreau collaborator John Debney,[29] mostly drawing from George Bruns' original music. Though Favreau decided not to make the film a musical, nevertheless, he and Debney incorporated several songs from the 1967 animated film.[30] \"The Bare Necessities,\" written by Terry Gilkyson, is performed by Murray and Sethi,[12] and a cover version by Dr. John is featured in the end credits. \"I Wan'na Be Like You\" and \"Trust in Me\"\u2014written by the Sherman Brothers\u2014are performed by Walken and Johansson, respectively; Richard M. Sherman wrote revised lyrics for Walken's version of \"I Wan'na Be Like You.\"[12] Johansson's rendition of \"Trust in Me\" was produced by Mark Ronson and appears in the end credits only.[12]",
            "Be Like Mike\nAfter seeing an early cut of the commercial, just featuring highlights of Jordan dunking, advertising executive Bernie Pitzel was disappointed. Pitzel came up with an idea to use the song \"I Wanna Be Like You\" from the 1967 film The Jungle Book, though Disney asked for more money in licensing to use it than Gatorade was willing to pay.[1][2]",
            "I Wan'na Be like You (The Monkey Song)\n\"I Wan'na Be like You\" is a song from Walt Disney's 1967 film The Jungle Book. The song was written by songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman and was performed by Louis Prima.[1]",
            "The Jungle Book (1967 film)\nMany characters appear in the 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c91 animated series TaleSpin.[50] Between 1996 and 1998, the TV series Jungle Cubs told the stories of Baloo, Hahti, Bagheera, Louie, Kaa, and Shere Khan when they were children.[51] Disney later made a live-action remake of the film, which was more of a realistic action-adventure film with somewhat-more adult themes. The film, released in 1994, differs even more from the book than its animated counterpart, but was still a box-office success. In 1998, Disney released a direct to video film entitled The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story.[52] A new live-action version of The Jungle Book was released by Disney in 2016, which even reused most of the songs of the animated movie, with some lyrical reworking by original composer Richard M. Sherman.[53]",
            "The Jungle Book (1967 film)\nBaloo was also based on footage of bears, even incorporating the animal's penchant for scratching. Since Kaa has no limbs, its design received big expressive eyes, and parts of Kaa's body did the action that normally would be done with hands.[22] The monkeys' dance during \"I Wan'na Be Like You\" was partially inspired by a performance Louis Prima did with his band at Disney's soundstage to convince Walt Disney to cast him.[8]",
            "Scat singing\nFree jazz and the influence of world musicians on the medium pushed jazz singing nearer to avant-garde art music.[16] In the 1960s Ward Swingle was the product of an unusually liberal musical education. He took the scat singing idea and applied it to the works of Bach, creating The Swingle Singers. Scat singing is also featured by Louis Prima and others in the song \"I Wan'na Be Like You\" in Disney's The Jungle Book (1967).",

            "You'll Be in My Heart\nIn the movie the song ends on the first verse, the full version of the song on the soundtrack album notes that others don't understand why a mother and child who are so different can love each other. When destiny calls, the child is told he must be strong even if the parent is not with him. The song is one of only two songs within Disney's Tarzan to have a part performed by an actual character (the other being \"Trashin' the Camp\" which the character's role in the song can be classified as scat singing). The rest of the songs were performed by Collins himself and overlaid into the movie. The full song is finally played all together during the end credits.",
            "The Jungle Book (1967 film)\nElements of The Jungle Book were recycled in the later Disney feature film Robin Hood due to that film's limited budget, such as Baloo being inspiration for Little John (who not only was a bear, but also voiced by Phil Harris). In particular, the dance sequence between Baloo and King Louie was simply rotoscoped for Little John and Lady Cluck's dance.[48] It has been widely acclaimed by animators, with Eric Goldberg declaring The Jungle Book \"boasts possibly the best character animation a studio has ever done\". The animators of Aladdin, The Lion King and Lilo & Stitch took inspiration from the design and animation of the film, and four people involved with Disney's animations, director Brad Bird and animators Andreas Deja, Glen Keane and Sergio Pablos, have declared the film to be their inspiration for entering the business.[49]",
            "You'll Be in My Heart\nManilla Standard said Collins \"waxes poetic\" with the song.\n[4] The Disney Song Encyclopedia deemed it an \"uptempo ballad\" and \"tender song\".[5] American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle said that Merle Dandridge, who sang this song as the role of Tarzan's adoptive mother Kala in the Broadway version, had \"the best song\".[7] American Literature on Stage and Screen: 525 Works and Their Adaptations said this song was \"contemporary sounding yet [its] rhythmic momentum blended beautifully with the pulsating sounds of the jungle\".[8] Billboard said the song ran \"in the same vein\" as another Collins song \"Can't Stop Loving You\".[9] Musical Experience in Our Lives: Things We Learn and Meanings We Make recounted a personal story of how the song has a special meaning to a mother/daughter relationship involving fetus-singing.[10] Similar stories were recounted by two other sources.[11][12]",
            "If You Wanna Be Happy\nThe song is featured in the films Clean and Sober (1988), Chances Are (1989), Mermaids (1990)  Rocky and Bullwinkle (2014) and on the soundtrack of My Best Friend's Wedding (1997). The song, or possibly Roaring Lion's version, can also be heard in Tiger Bay (1959) sung by a group of street musicians at a wedding.",
            "Smash Mouth\nIn 2003, Get the Picture? was released, featuring the singles \"You Are My Number One\", \"Hang On\" and \"Always Gets Her Way\". Smash Mouth was dropped from Interscope shortly after the release of Get the Picture?. That same year, the band performed a cover of the Sherman Brothers song \"I Wanna Be Like You\" for the animated film The Jungle Book 2.",
            "The Jungle Book (1967 film)\nIn 1968, Disneyland Records released the album More Jungle Book, an unofficial sequel also written by screenwriter Larry Simmons, which continued the story of the film, and included Phil Harris and Louis Prima voicing their film roles. In the record, Baloo (Harris) is missing Mowgli (Ginny Tyler), so he teams up with King Louie (Prima) and Bagheera (Dal McKennon) to take him from the man village.[45] On February 14, 2003, DisneyToon Studios in Australia released a film sequel, The Jungle Book 2, in which Mowgli runs away from the man village to see his animal friends, unaware that Shere Khan is more determined to kill him than ever.[46] In 2005, screenwriter Robert Reece pitched Jungle Book 3 to Disney execs. However, the project never materialized.[47]",
            "Baby, I Love Your Way\nThe song was recorded by the American reggae/pop band Big Mountain in 1994, reaching number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart[1] and number 2 on the UK Singles Chart (being kept off the top spot by \"Love is All Around\" by Wet Wet Wet). Their version achieved major worldwide success, reaching the top ten in many countries across Europe. Their version is featured on the soundtrack for the 1994 movie Reality Bites. In the film itself, Michael Grates (played by Ben Stiller) explains that he used to listen to the Frampton song a lot.[citation needed] This version was also played during the 2017 film Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle during two fight sequences.",
            "Like I'm Gonna Lose You\nInitially intended to be a solo recording, L.A. Reid sent it to John Legend, who shares the same management as Trainor.[5][6] Legend said, \"I love this: I want to be a part of it\".[5] Trainor announced her collaboration with Legend in an interview with MTV News at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in September 2014.[5] His vocal was recorded as a duet with Trainor's by Jason Agel at Germano Studios in New York City, with the assistance of Kenta Yonesaka. \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larabee North Studios in Universal City, California and mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City.[4] Gelbuda describes it as \"classic and jazzy\" and \"a big departure from everything she's done\".[7]",
            "I Just Want to Be Your Everything\nTwo mixes were prepared for the song, the more popular mix was released on the album & as the single version and the earlier mix was used for promotional uses. The promotional version had an additional keyboard that at times competed with the lead vocal. The drummer's high-hat count during both breakdowns was completely mixed out and Gibb's harmony vocal is more prevalent during add-libs.[citation needed]",
            "You'll Be in My Heart\nIn the 2006 stage version, the song is performed by Kala with the ensemble, while a reprise is performed by Kala and Tarzan when the latter \"decides to join the human world\".[5] This was because the omniscience of Collins' songs did not translate too well, so the song along with Two Worlds, \"perform similar thematic and character introductions on stage\".[6]",
            "The Jungle Book\nThe book's text has been adapted for younger readers with comic book adaptations such as DC Comics Elseworlds' story, \"Superman: The Feral Man of Steel\", in which an infant Supermanis raised by wolves, while Bagheera, Akela, and Shere Khan make appearances.[34] Marvel Comics published several adaptations by Mary Jo Duffy and Gil Kane in the pages of Marvel Fanfare (vol. 1).

It was sung by a quartet of \"mop top\" vultures who are making friends with Mowgli, the main character of the film. The song was written by Disney staff songwriters, Robert and Richard Sherman, and sung primarily by J. Pat O'Malley, Lord Tim Hudson, Digby Wolfe, and Chad Stuart. Bruce Reitherman and George Sanders both made cameo appearances in the song singing as Mowgli and Shere Khan the tiger, respectively, in different parts.

That's the idea, we'll make him a jazz man.\" Once Prima was invited to do the song, he mockingly responded to the Shermans with \"You want to make a monkey out of me? You got me!\" The instrumentals were originally recorded by Prima\u2014who also played the trumpet\u2014and his band, Sam Butera & The Witnesses, but the music was replaced by one written by the film's composer, George Bruns, and orchestrated by Walter Sheets. The \"scat dialogue\" between Baloo and King Louie was the result of two recording sessions. Louis Prima recorded first, with the intent that Baloo\u2014played in his recording by Butera\u2014would simply repeat what Louie scatted, but Phil Harris decided not to imitate Prima's recording and made up his own.

It was also planned to have the members of the band to both voice the characters and sing their song, \"That's What Friends Are For\". However, the Beatles member John Lennon's refusal to work on animated films in that period led to the idea being discarded.[19] The casting of the vultures still brought a British Invasion musician, Chad Stuart of the duo Chad & Jeremy.[8] In earlier drafts of the scene the vultures had a near-sighted rhinoceros friend named Rocky, who was to be voiced by Frank Fontaine.

I thought it would be ridiculous.\"[12] Instead, Collins would perform the songs in the film serving as the narrator.[20][21] The choice of Collins, a popular and well established adult contemporary artist, led to comparisons with Elton John's earlier music for The Lion King.[22] Tarzan was dubbed in thirty-five languages\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe most for any Disney movie at the time,[23] and Collins recorded his songs in French, Italian, German, and Spanish for the dubbed versions of the film's soundtrack.[23][24] According to Collins, most of the songs he wrote for Tarzan came from improvisation sessions and his reactions while reading the treatment.[5] Three of the songs he wrote, \"Son of Man,\" \"Trashin' the Camp,\" and \"Strangers Like Me,\" were based on his initial impressions after he read the source material.

            "Jackie Evancho\nEvancho promoted the album on television and at concerts.[102][103] Her first solo concert television special for the 2011 PBS Great Performances series consisted of performances of largely the same songs as the album.[104][105] The special, titled Dream With Me In Concert, was the most broadcast program of the year on the PBS network.[106] It \"became one of the most viewed specials in the 38-year-history of the Great Performances series [and] raised record amounts of money for PBS stations.\"[107] Evancho was the youngest person ever to have a special on the series.[108] The concert was hosted by David Foster,[109] with guest Conrad Tao.[110][111] The CD/DVD release[112] reached No. 1 on Billboard's Top Music Video chart.[93][113] Evancho performed \"Nessun dorma\" as a guest artist at the June 2011 season finale of Britain's Got Talent,[36][114] and at the September 2011 season finale of America's Got Talent.[115]",
            "Whitney Houston\nHouston was a mezzo-soprano,[294][295] and was commonly referred to as \"The Voice\" in reference to her exceptional vocal talent.[296] She was third in MTV's list of 22 Greatest Voices,[297] and sixth on Online Magazine COVE's list of the 100 Best Pop Vocalists with a score of 48.5/50.[298] Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated she \"always had a great big voice, a technical marvel from its velvety depths to its ballistic middle register to its ringing and airy heights\".[299] In 2008, Rolling Stone listed Houston as the thirty-fourth of the 100 greatest singers of all time, stating, \"Her voice is a mammoth, coruscating cry: Few vocalists could get away with opening a song with 45 unaccompanied seconds of singing, but Houston's powerhouse version of Dolly Parton's 'I Will Always Love You' is a tour de force.\"[104] Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone also eulogized Houston's vocal, enumerating ten performances, including \"How Will I Know\" from the 1986 MTV VMAs and \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at the 1991 Super Bowl. \"Whitney Houston was blessed with an astonishing vocal range and extraordinary technical skill, but what truly made her a great singer was her ability to connect with a song and drive home its drama and emotion with incredible precision\", he stated. \"She was a brilliant performer, and her live shows often eclipsed her studio recordings.\"[300]",
            "Bohemian Rhapsody\nAlthough the song has become one of the most revered in popular music history,[44] some initial critical reaction was poor. Melody Maker said that Queen \"contrived to approximate the demented fury of the Balham Amateur Operatic Society performing The Pirates of Penzance\".[13] The newspaper's critic Allan Jones heard only a \"superficially impressive pastiche\" of operatic styles.[33] However, there has been a positive reception from other musicians, including from Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, who called it in 1976 \"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\" and \"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof artistic music\".[45] Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".[46]",
            "Artists with the most number-ones on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n\"We Belong Together\" spent 14 weeks at number-one in 2005,[12] while \"Don't Forget About Us\" became her seventeenth chart topper, tying her with Presley.[21] \"Touch My Body\" became Carey's eighteenth number-one song on the Hot 100 in 2008, breaking her tie with Presley and placing her second for the most chart toppers in the history of the chart.[22] It also means that Carey is in fourth place for songwriters with the most-number ones, with 17, only behind Max Martin (21), John Lennon (26) and Paul McCartney (32).[23] Carey and Presley hold the record for having spent 79 weeks at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100.[12][24] Carey holds the record for solo artist with the most number-ones.[12]",
            "Live Aid\nQueen's performance has been voted \u2013 by more than 60 artists, journalists and music industry executives \u2013 the greatest live performance in the history of rock.[16][17] Queen's lead singer Freddie Mercury at times led the crowd in unison refrains,[18] and his sustained note during the a cappella section came to be known as \"The Note Heard Round the World\".[17] The band's 20-minute set opened with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and closed with \"We Are the Champions\".[2][19][20] Mercury and fellow band member Brian May later sang the first song of the three-part Wembley event finale, \"Is This the World We Created...?\"[20]",
            "Ray Charles (musician, born 1918)\nOn a cruise in 1964, Charles heard a Mexican song called \"Cuando Calienta el Sol\". He liked it, recorded it, under the English title \"Love Me with All Your Heart\", and his recording became a hit, riding to #3 on Billboard Magazine, #2 on Cashbox Magazine. This was followed by \"Al Di La\", also a very popular recording. The Ray Charles Singers were not one group of vocalists. They were different combinations of singers on records, tours and TV shows. What made them the Ray Charles Singers was the conducting and arranging of Ray Charles. He generally recorded with 20 singers (12 men and 8 women; and these vocalists appeared on Perry Como's television show. The Ray Charles Singers also were the voices behind many commercial jingles.[9]",

            "History of the United States Democratic Party\nThe 2012 election was characterized by very high spending, especially on negative television ads in about ten critical states. Despite a weak economic recovery and high unemployment, the Obama campaign successfully mobilized its coalition of youth, blacks, Hispanics and women. The campaign carried all the same states as in 2008 except two, Indiana and North Carolina. The election continued the pattern whereby Democrats won more votes in all presidential elections after 1988, except for 2004. Obama and the Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, losing nine seats in that body and 13 in the GOP House.[citation needed]",
            "United States House of Representatives\nThe Republicans took control of the House in 1995, under the leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich attempted to pass a major legislative program, the Contract with America, on which the House Republicans had been elected, and made major reforms of the House, notably reducing the tenure of committee chairs to three two-year terms. Many elements of the Contract did not pass Congress, were vetoed by President Bill Clinton, or were substantially altered in negotiations with Clinton. The Republicans held on to the House until 2006, when the Democrats won control and Nancy Pelosi was subsequently elected by the House as the first female Speaker. The Republicans retook the House in 2011, with the largest shift of power since the 1930s.[7]",
            "United States\nIn 2010, the Obama administration passed the Affordable Care Act, which made the most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016,[214] but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance.[215] Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.[216]",
            "United States federal government shutdown of 2013\nThe tensions that would ultimately produce the 2013 shutdown began to take shape after Republicans, strengthened by the emergence of the Tea Party, won back a majority of the seats in the House of Representatives from the Democrats in 2010.[21][22][23][24] Even at that time, some conservative activists and Tea Party-affiliated politicians were already calling on congressional Republicans to be willing to shut down the government in order to force congressional Democrats and the President to agree to deep cuts in spending and to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which had been signed into law only a few months earlier. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, a Republican who had presided over Congress during the last government shutdowns 15 years earlier, said in April 2010 that if Republicans won back control of Congress in the 2010 election, they should remove any funding for the Affordable Care Act in any appropriations bills they passed. Gingrich said Republicans needed to \"be ready to stand on principle\" and should refuse to fund the new healthcare law even if their refusal would result in a shutdown of the government.[25]",
            "Democratic Party (United States)\nIn the wake of the 2001 World Trade Center terrorist attacks and with growing concern over global warming, some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century have included the methods of how to combat terrorism, homeland security, expanding access to health care, labor rights, environmentalism and the preservation of liberal government programs.[31] Barack Obama won the Democratic Party's nomination and was elected as the first African American president in 2008. The Democrats gained control of both chambers of Congress in the wake of the 2007 economic recession. The Democratic Party under the Obama presidency moved forward reforms including an Economic Stimulus package, the Dodd-Frank financial reform act and the Affordable Care Act. In the 2010 elections, the Democratic Party lost control of the House and lost its majority in state legislatures and state governorships. In the 2012 elections, President Obama was re-elected, but the party kept its minority in the House of Representatives and in 2014 the party lost control of the Senate for the first time since 2006. After the 2016 election of Donald Trump, the Democratic Party transitioned into the role of an opposition party and currently hold neither the presidency nor a majority in the House or Senate.",
            "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives\nSo far, the Democrats have always elevated their minority leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority control of the House. However, Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern. In 1919, Republicans bypassed James Robert Mann, R-IL, who had been Minority Leader for eight years, and elected a backbencher representative, Frederick H. Gillett, R-MA, to be Speaker. Mann had \"angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor,\" and was also a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of autocratic Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon (R-IL18) who had been Speaker from 1903 to 1911, and was still in the House. Many members \"suspected that he [Mann] would try to re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker.\"[6] More recently, although Robert H. Michel was Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections, he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign, including the \"Contract with America\", which was unveiled six weeks before Election Day. Michel opted not to seek re-election because he had been isolated in the caucus by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and other younger and more aggressive Congressmen.",
            "Impeachment of Bill Clinton\nOf the 13 members of the House who managed Clinton's trial in the Senate, one lost to a Democrat in his 2000 bid for re-election (James E. Rogan, to Adam Schiff). Charles Canady retired from Congress in 2000, following through on a previous term limits pledge to voters, and Bill McCollum ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Asa Hutchinson, after being re-elected in 2000, left Congress after being appointed head of the Drug Enforcement Administration by President George W. Bush. In 2014 Hutchinson was elected governor of Arkansas. In 2002, two former House managers lost their seats after redistricting placed them in the same district as another incumbent (Bob Barr lost to John Linder in a Republican primary, and George Gekas lost to Democrat Tim Holden), while two more ran for the U.S. Senate (Lindsey Graham successfully, Ed Bryant unsuccessfully). The other five remained in the House well into the 2000s (decade), and two (Jim Sensenbrenner and Steve Chabot) are still members (although Chabot lost his seat to Steve Driehaus in the 2008 elections; Chabot defeated Driehaus in a 2010 rematch). In 2009, Sensenbrenner served again as a manager for the impeachment of Judge Samuel B. Kent of Texas[50] as well as serving in 2010 as Republican lead manager in the impeachment of Judge Thomas Porteous of Louisiana.[51]",
            "Southern United States\nIn the 1994 mid-term elections, another Southern politician, Newt Gingrich, led the Republican Revolution, ushering in twelve years of GOP control of the House. Gingrich became Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in 1995 and served until his resignation in 1999. Tom DeLay was the most powerful Republican leader in Congress[citation needed] until he was indicted under criminal charges in 2005 and was forced to step aside by Republican rules.[citation needed] Apart from Bob Dole from Kansas (1985\u201396), the recent Republican Senate Leaders have been Southerners: Howard Baker (1981\u20131985) of Tennessee, Trent Lott (1996\u20132003) of Mississippi, Bill Frist (2003\u20132006) of Tennessee, and Mitch McConnell (2007\u2013present) of Kentucky.",
            "American Health Care Act of 2017\nFrom President Obama's inauguration in January 2009 until the November 2010 elections, both houses of Congress and the presidency were controlled by the Democratic Party. During the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney, running against Obama, promised to repeal the ACA, despite its similarity to Romneycare.[34] After Romney's defeat, the ACA remained in effect for the duration of Obama's presidency despite Republican efforts to repeal it. In the 114th Congress, Republicans passed a bill that would have repealed much of the ACA, but the bill was vetoed by President Obama.[35] After winning the 2016 presidential election, President Donald Trump promised to \"repeal and replace\" the ACA with a new law.[36] The 2016 elections left Republicans in control of the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government, but with fifty-two seats in the one-hundred member Senate, Republicans would still have to rely on at least some Senate Democrats to overcome a filibuster.[37] However, Senate rules provide for a special budget rule called reconciliation, which allows certain budget-related bills to bypass the filibuster and be enacted with a simple majority vote.[37] Republican leaders were seeking to pass the AHCA through the Senate by using the reconciliation rule.[37][38]",
            "Florida's congressional districts\nThe legislature had adopted new districts in 2012 as a result of the 2010 census. Their product was soon challenged in early 2011 by groups who had worked for passage of the amendments, including the League of Women Voters and Common Cause.[3] The trial revealed much secret dealings by party operatives and lawmakers; the court set a new legal standard. At one point the court excluded the press and shut down the TV feed in order to allow three hours of testimony by a political operative.[3]",

Tea Party Caucus founder Michele Bachmann was re-elected to the House by a narrow margin.[130]",
            "Pennsylvania\nIn recent national elections, Pennsylvania has leaned Democratic. The state voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992 and 2012. During the 2008 election campaign a recruitment drive saw registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However, Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1947. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats won back the governor's mansion 4 years later in the 2014 election. It was the first time since a governor became eligible to succeed himself that an incumbent governor had been defeated for reelection.",

Nancy Pelosi became Speaker when the 110th Congress convened on January 4, 2007, making her the first female to hold the office. With the election of Barack Obama as President and Democratic gains in both houses of Congress, Pelosi became the first Speaker since Tom Foley to hold the office during single-party Democratic leadership in Washington.[14] During the 111th Congress, Pelosi was the driving force behind several of Obama's major initiatives that proved controversial, and the Republicans campaigned against the Democrats' legislation by staging a \"Fire Pelosi\" bus tour[15] and regained control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections. House Minority Leader John Boehner was elected as Speaker.[16]",
            "History of the United States Republican Party\nAfter leading a pack of minor candidates for much of 2010 and 2011, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, despite outmatching his opponents in both money and organization, struggled to hold on to his lead for the 2012 GOP nomination. As the presidential campaign season headed toward the voting stage in January 2012, one candidate after another surged past Romney, held the lead for a few weeks, then fell back. According to the RealClearPolitics 2012 polling index, five candidates at one time or another were the top choice of GOP voters: Texas Governor Rick Perry, motivational speaker Herman Cain, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Senator Rick Santorum and Romney himself.[84]",
            "United States Senate elections, 2014\nBy midnight ET, most major networks projected that the Republicans would take control of the Senate. The party held all three competitive Republican-held seats (Kentucky, Kansas, and Georgia), and defeated incumbent Democrats in North Carolina, Colorado, and Arkansas. Combined with the pick-ups of open seats in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, the Republicans made a net gain of 7 seats before the end of the night. In the process of taking control of the Senate, Republicans defeated three incumbent Democrats, a task the party had not accomplished since the 1980 election.[15] Five of the seven confirmed pickups were in states that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, but two of the seats that Republicans won represent states that voted for Barack Obama in 2012 (Colorado and Iowa). Of the three races that were not called by the end of election night, Alaska and Virginia were still too close to call, while Louisiana held a December 6 run-off election. Virginia declared Democrat Mark Warner the winner of his race by a narrow margin over Republican Ed Gillespie on November 7, and Alaska declared Dan Sullivan the winner against Democratic incumbent Mark Begich a week later, on November 12. Republican Bill Cassidy defeated Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu in the Louisiana runoff on December 6.",

Democrat Russ Feingold was the only Senator to vote against the Patriot Act in 2001. Republican Paul Ryan was, at age 28, the youngest member of the Congressional freshman class when he took office in January 1999. In 2012, he was selected as the Republican party's candidate for Vice President, running with Mitt Romney. In 2004, Gwen Moore, a Democrat from Milwaukee, became Wisconsin's first African-American U.S. Representative.",

Republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected the African-American and Hispanic vote (as required by the Civil Rights laws), but split up the remaining white Democrats so that Republicans mostly would win.[68] In 2006, the Supreme Court endorsed nearly all of the gerrymandering engineered by Tom DeLay that swung the Texas Congressional delegation to the GOP in 2004. DeLay himself was acquitted on appeal in 2013 of illegally funding the state GOP.",

            "History of Pennsylvania\nThe Republican lock on Pennsylvania was permanently broken in the era after World War II, and Pennsylvania became a somewhat less powerful state in terms of electoral votes and number of House seats. Pennsylvania adopted its fifth and current constitution in 1968; the new constitution established a unified judicial system and allows governors and the other statewide elected officials to serve two consecutive terms.[53] Between 1954 and 2012, each party consistently won two straight gubernatorial elections before ceding control to the other party. In presidential elections, the Republican Party won Pennsylvania in seven of the eleven elections between 1948 and 1988, but Democrats have won the state in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. When Democratic presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey won Pennsylvania's electoral votes in 1968, he became the first non-Republican since 1824 to win Pennsylvania's votes without winning the presidential election. After having the second most electoral votes since the 18th century, Pennsylvania was eclipsed in electoral votes by California in 1964. Texas and Florida also now have more electoral votes, while New York also has more electoral votes and Illinois has the same number of electoral votes (and a slightly larger population). As of 2014, Pennsylvania is generally considered to be an important swing state in both presidential and congressional elections, and Pennsylvania has a Cook PVI of D+1. Since the 1990s, Republicans have usually controlled both houses of the legislature, while candidates from both parties have been elected to the statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, treasurer, and auditor general. Democrats generally win the cities and Republicans win the rural areas, with the suburbs voting for both parties and often acting as the key swing areas.[54]",

During the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans swept the South, successfully reelecting every Senate incumbent, electing freshmen Marco Rubio in Florida and Rand Paul in Kentucky, and defeating Democratic incumbent Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas for a seat now held by John Boozman. In the House, Republicans reelected every incumbent except for Joseph Cao of New Orleans and defeated several Democratic incumbents. Republicans are now the majority in the congressional delegations of every Southern state. Every Solid South state, with the exceptions of Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, and West Virginia, also elected or reelected Republicans governors. Most significantly, Republicans took control of both houses of the Alabama and North Carolina State Legislatures for the first time since Reconstruction, with Mississippi and Louisiana flipping a year later during their off-year elections. Even in Arkansas, the GOP won three of six statewide down-ballot positions for which they had often not fielded candidates until recently; they also went from eight to 15 out of 35 seats in the State Senate and from 28 to 45 out of 100 in the State House of Representatives. In 2012, the Republicans finally took control of the Arkansas State Legislature and the North Carolina Governorship, leaving West Virginia as the last Solid South state with the Democrats still in control of the state legislature, as well as the governorship.

The strongly liberal policies of Clinton's first two years in office were also a cause of controversy, and the Democrats suddenly lost control of the House and the Senate for the first time in four decades in the 1994 midterm elections.

            "Puerto Rican Campaign\nThe administration of Puerto Rico was the responsibility of the United States Department of War's Division of Insular Affairs which was molded after the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Almost immediately, the United States began the 'Americanization\" process of Puerto Rico. The U.S. occupation brought about a total change in Puerto Rico's economy and polity and did not apply democratic principles to the colony. Puerto Rico was classified as an 'unincorporated territory\" which meant that the protections of the United States Constitution did not automatically apply because the island belonged to the U.S., but was not part of the U.S.[60]",

Since this law was the result of Congressional legislation, and not the result of an amendment to the United States Constitution, the current U.S. citizenship of Puerto Ricans can be revoked by Congress,[66] as they are statutory citizens, not 14th Amendment citizens.[67] The Jones Act established that Puerto Ricans born prior to 1899 were considered naturalized citizens of Puerto Rico, and anyone born after 1898 were U.S. citizens, unless the Puerto Rican expressed his/her intentions to remain a Spanish subject. Since 1948, it was decided by Congress that all Puerto Ricans, whether born within the United States or in Puerto Rico, were naturally born United States citizens.",

Attributable to the changing citizenship status of the island's residents, Puerto Ricans can technically be said to have come to the City first as immigrants and subsequently as migrants. The first group of Puerto Ricans moved to New York in the mid-19th century, when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony and its people Spanish subjects. The following wave of Puerto Ricans to move to New York did so after the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898 made Puerto Rico a U.S. possession and after the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act of 1917 gave Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship, which allows travel without the need of a passport between the island and the United States mainland. The largest wave of migration came in the 1950s, in what became known as \"The Great Migration\"; as a result, more than a million Puerto Ricans once called New York City home. Presently the Puerto Rican population is around 800,000.",

Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory (see above) and not a U.S. state, the United States Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.[247][260]",
            "Demographics of Puerto Rico\nThe federal Naturalization Act, signed into law on March 26, 1790, by President Washington stated that immigrants to the United States had to be White according to the definition under the British Common Law, which the United States inherited. The legal definition of Whiteness differed greatly from White Society's informal definition, thus Jews, Gypsies, Middle Eastern Peoples and those of the Indian Subcontinent were before 1917 classified as White for Immigration purposes but not considered White by the society at large. The Naturalization Act of 1870, passed during Reconstruction, allowed for peoples of African descent to become U.S. Citizens but it excluded other nonwhites. The U.S. Supreme Court in the case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898) declared that all nonwhites who were born in the United States were eligible for citizenship via the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. U.S. Immigration Policy was first restricted toward Chinese with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Gentleman's Agreement of 1907 in which Japan voluntarily barred emigration to the United States and the Immigration Act of 1917 or the Asiatic Barred Zone which barred immigrants from all of the Middle East, the Steppes and the Orient, excluding the Philippines which was then a US Colony. European Jews and Gypsies, although of Asiatic Ancestry, were not affected by the Asiatic Barred Zone, as they held European Citizenship. The Johnson-Reed act of 1924 applied only to the Eastern Hemisphere. The Act imposed immigration quotas on Europe, which allowed for easy immigration from Northern and Western Europe, but almost excluded the Mediterranean and Slavic Nations. Africa and Asia were excluded altogether. The Western Hemisphere remained unrestricted to immigrate to the United States. Thus under the Immigration Act of 1924 all Hispanics and Caribbeans could immigrate to the United States, but a White family from Poland or Russia could not immigrate. Puerto Rican Citizenship was created under the Foraker Act, Pub.L. 56\u2013191, 31 Stat. 77 but it wasn't until 1917 that Puerto Ricans were granted full American Citizenship under the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act (Pub.L. 64\u2013368, 39 Stat. 951. Puerto Ricans, excluding those of obvious African ancestry, were like most Hispanics formally classified as White under U.S. Law, but this classification did not prevent informal discrimination against them by Anglo-Americans.",
            "History of Puerto Rico\nThe Jones Act was made to replace the Foraker Act, which allowed for the free entry of Puerto Rican goods into the U.S. market.[58] The Jones Act was approved by the U.S. Congress on December 5, 1916, and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on March 2, 1917.[54] Although it extended citizenship to Puerto Ricans, it wasn't always welcomed. The Partido Union had opposed extension of U.S. citizenship in 1912 if it didn't make Puerto Rico a state. If they didn't become a state, U.S. citizenship would be interpreted as an attempt to block independence of the Puerto Ricans. For them, the promise of citizenship didn't affirm the promise of statehood, it excluded any considerations of independence.[58]",

Most Puerto Rico residents do not pay federal income tax but do pay federal payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare). However, federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico\u2013based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S. and others do pay federal income taxes. Puerto Ricans may enlist in the U.S. military. Puerto Ricans have participated in all American wars since 1898; 52 Puerto Ricans had been killed in the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan by November 2012.[12]",
            "New York City ethnic enclaves\nPuerto Ricans have been immigrating to New York since 1838, though they did not arrive in large numbers until the 20th century. In 1910 only 500 Puerto Ricans lived in New York, but by 1970 that number had skyrocketed to over 800,000, and 40% of those lived in the Bronx.[155] Unlike the other four boroughs, Puerto Rican populations are significant throughout the Bronx, though there is slightly higher concentrations in the South Bronx.[156] The first group of Puerto Ricans immigrated to New York City in the mid-19th century when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony and its people Spanish subjects and as such they were immigrants. The following wave of Puerto Ricans to move to New York City did so after the Spanish\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAmerican War in 1898.[157] Puerto Ricans were no longer Spanish subjects and citizens of Spain, they were now Puerto Rican citizens of an American possession and needed passports to travel to the mainland of the United States. That was until 1917, when the United States Congress approved Jones-Shafroth Act which gave Puerto Ricans in the island a U.S. citizenship with certain limitations. Puerto Ricans living in the mainland U.S. however, were given full American citizenship and were allowed to seek political office in the states which they resided. Two months later, when Congress passed the Selective Service Act, conscription was extended to the Puerto Ricans both in the island and in the U.S. It was expected that Puerto Rican men 18 years and older serve in the military [158] during World War I.[159] The Jones-Shafroth Act also allowed Puerto Ricans to travel between Puerto Rico and the United States mainland without the need of a passport, thereby becoming migrants. The advent of air travel was one of the principal factors that led to the largest wave of migration of Puerto Ricans to New York City in the 1950s, known as \"The Great Migration\". Although Florida has received some dispersal of the population, there has been a resurgence in Puerto Rican migration to New York and New Jersey[160][161] - consequently, the New York City Metropolitan Area has witnessed an increase in its Puerto Rican population from 1,177,430 in 2010 to a Census-estimated 1,201,850 in 2012,[162] maintaining its status by a significant margin as the most important cultural and demographic center for Puerto Rican Americans outside San Juan.",
            "Puerto Rican citizenship\nOn April 12, 1900, the United States Congress enacted the Foraker Act of 1900, which replaced the governing military regime in Puerto Rico with a civil form of government. Section VII of this act created a Puerto Rican citizenship for the residents \"born in Puerto Rico and, therefore, subject to its jurisdiction\".[2] The Puerto Rican citizenship replaced the Spanish citizenship that Puerto Ricans held at the time.[13] in 1898.[14] Such Puerto Rican citizenship was granted by Spain in 1897.[15] This citizenship was reaffirmed by the United States Supreme Court in 1904 by its ruling in Gonzales v. Williams which denied that Puerto Ricans were United States citizens and labeled them as noncitizen nationals.[16] In a 1914 letter of refusal to the offer of U.S. citizenship and addressed to both the President of the United States and the U.S. Congress, the Puerto Rico House of Delegates stated \"We, Porto Ricans, Spanish-Americans, of Latin soul ... are satisfied with our own beloved Porto Rican citizenship, and proud to have been born and brethren in our own motherland.\"[17] The official 1916 Report by the American colonial governor of Puerto Rico to the U.S. Secretary of War (the former name for the Department of Defense[18]), addresses both citizenships, the Puerto Rican citizenship and United States citizenship,[19] in the context of the issuance of passports, further evidencing that the Puerto Rican citizenship did not disappear when the Americans took over the island in 1898.",

Nearly 41,800 state residents (Nuyoricans) in 1990 had lived in Puerto Rico in 1985. According to the Census taken in the year 2000, Puerto Rican migrants made up 1.2% of the total population of the United States, with a population of well over 3 million Puerto Ricans (including those of Puerto Rican descent). If taken into account together with the almost 4 million Puerto Ricans who are U.S. citizens (nevertheless, excluded by the U.S. Census statistics of U.S. population), Puerto Ricans make up about 2.5% of the total population of U.S. citizens around the world (within and outside the U.S. mainland).[72]",
            "Puerto Rican citizenship\nOn March 2, 1917, the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act was signed, collectively making Puerto Ricans United States citizens without rescinding their Puerto Rican citizenship. In 1922, the U.S. Supreme court in the case of Balzac v. Porto Rico ruled that the full protection and rights of the U.S constitution do not apply to residents of Puerto Rico until they come to reside in the United States proper. Luis Mu\u00f1oz Rivera, who participated in the creation of the Jones-Shafroth Act, gave a speech in the U.S. House floor that argued in favor of Puerto Rican citizenship. He declared that \"if the earth were to swallow the island, Puerto Ricans would prefer American citizenship to any citizenship in the world. But as long as the island existed, the residents preferred Puerto Rican citizenship.\"[20] The Jones Act allowed locals to renounce the United States citizenship and remain exclusively Puerto Rican citizens, at the cost of being stripped of the right to vote.[21] Despite these arbitrary limitations, 287 residents completed the process to forfeit the statutory recognition.[21]",

The constitution, approved by the U.S. congress, went into effect in 1952. In addition, like the States, Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation,\" for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations,\" which was retained by the Federal Government.",

A 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center indicates that, as of 2007, 4.1 million Puerto Ricans lived in the mainland versus 3.9 million living in the Island.[154] Since the 1967 referendum, there have been demands that stateside Puerto Ricans be allowed to vote in these plebiscites on the political status of Puerto Rico. Since the 1990s, the role of stateside Puerto Ricans in advocating for Puerto Rico in Washington, D.C., on issues such as the Navy's removal from Vieques and others has increased, especially given that there have been three voting members of the U.S. Congress who are stateside Puerto Ricans (two from New York City and one from Chicago), in contrast to Puerto Rico's single Resident Commissioner in the U.S. Congress with no vote.",
            "Political status of Puerto Rico\nFormer chief of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Jos\u00e9 Tr\u00edas Monge insists that statehood was never intended for the island and that, unlike Alaska and Hawaii, which Congress deemed incorporated territories and slated for annexation to the Union from the start, Puerto Rico was kept \"unincorporated\" specifically to avoid offering it statehood.[127] And Myriam Marquez has stated that Puerto Ricans \"fear that statehood would strip the people of their national identity, of their distinct culture and language\".[128] Ayala and Bernabe add that the \"purpose of the inclusion of U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans in the Jones Act of 1917 was an attempt by Congress to block independence and perpetuate Puerto Rico in its colonial status\".[129] Proponents of the citizenship clause in the Jones Act argue that \"the extension of citizenship did not constitute a promise of statehood but rather an attempt to exclude any consideration of independence\".[130]",

The official response to Mari Br\u00e1s stated that Puerto Rican citizenship existed only as an equivalent to residency.

            "Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt\nPuerto Rico had been something of an afterthought during the Spanish\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAmerican War, but it assumed importance due to its strategic position in the Caribbean Sea. The island provided an ideal naval base for defense of the Panama Canal, and it also served as an economic and political link to the rest of Latin America. Prevailing racist attitudes made Puerto Rican statehood unlikely, so the U.S. carved out a new political status for the island. The Foraker Act and subsequent Supreme Court cases established Puerto Rico as the first unincorporated territory, meaning that the United States Constitution would not fully apply to Puerto Rico. Though the U.S. imposed tariffs on most Puerto Rican imports, it also invested in the island's infrastructure and education system.

Puerto Ricans no longer needed a passport to travel to the U.S. and were allowed to seek public office in the mainland U.S.[19] The economic situation in the island was bad and continued to worsen as a result of the many hurricanes which destroyed most of its crops. Many Puerto Rican families migrated to the United States, the bulk of whom went to New York, in search of a better way of life.[17] In New York, they faced the same hardships and discrimination that earlier groups of immigrants, such as the Irish, the Italians, and the Jews, had faced before them. It was difficult for them to find well paying jobs because of the language barrier and their lack of technical working skills. The few men who found jobs worked for low salaries in factories. The women usually stayed home as housewives and tended to their children. Those who did not find jobs had the option of joining the United States Military.[20] Prior to the Jones-Shafroth Act, Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States as all other non-citizens, who were permanent residents were required to register with the Selective Service System by law and could be drafted,[21] however one of the effects of the Act was that all Puerto Ricans were now eligible for the military \"draft\" (conscription). One of the military units at that time was New York's U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment. Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez was a Puerto Rican who served in the almost all Afro-American unit.

The issue revolves around whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory, become a U.S. state, or become an independent country. The debate has spawned several referenda, presidential executive orders and bills in the U.S. Congress.

The U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor in 1948. In 1950, the Truman Administration allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution without affecting the unincorporated territory status with the U.S.[14] A local constitution was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year, and proclaimed by Gov.

            "Puerto Rico\nPuerto Ricans are by law natural-born citizens of the United States and may move freely between the island and the mainland.[25] As it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress, which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. However, Puerto Rico does have one non-voting member of the House called a Resident Commissioner. As a U.S. territory, American citizens residing in Puerto Rico are disenfranchised at the national level and do not vote for president and vice president of the United States,[26] and do not pay federal income tax on Puerto Rican income. Like other territories and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico does not have U.S. senators. Congress approved a local constitution, allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect a governor. A 2012 referendum showed a majority (54% of those who voted) disagreed with \"the present form of territorial status\". A second question asking about a new model, had full statehood the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status, although a significant number of people did not answer the second question of the referendum.[27] Another fifth referendum was held on June 11, 2017, with \"Statehood\" and \"Independence/Free Association\" initially as the only available choices. At the recommendation of the Department of Justice, an option for the \"current territorial status\" was added.[28] The referendum showed an overwhelming support for statehood, with 97.18% voting for it, although the voter turnout had a historically low figure of only 22.99% of the registered voters casting their ballots.",
            "Puerto Ricans\nAs statutory U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico may enlist in the U.S. military and have been included in the compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Puerto Ricans have fully participated in all U.S. wars and military conflicts since 1898, such as World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
            "Political status of Puerto Rico\nOn June 9, 2016, in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico vs Sanchez Valle, a 6-2 majority of the United States Supreme Court determined that Puerto Rico is a territory and lacks sovereignty. The opinion of the court stated: \"Back of the Puerto Rican people and their Constitution, the 'ultimate' source of prosecutorial power remains the U. S. Congress, just as back of a city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charter lies a state government.\"[84]",
            "Puerto Rican citizenship\nBased on the federal court ruling on Colon v. U.S. Department of State, on June 4, 1998\u2014and several months after the U.S. Government had accepted his renunciation\u2014the U.S. State Department notified the president of the Puerto Rico Socialist Party, Juan Mari Br\u00e1s, that they were rescinding their acceptance, and refused to accept Juan Mari Br\u00e1s' renunciation, determining that Mari Br\u00e1s could not renounce his American citizenship because he lived in Puerto Rico and not in another country foreign to the United States. This, said the federal agency, made Mari Br\u00e1s a U.S. citizen.[31][32]",
            "Puerto Rico\nOn April 29, 2010, the U.S. House voted 223\u00e2\u20ac\u201c169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, allowing Puerto Rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth, or to have a different political status. If Puerto Ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth, the Government of Puerto Rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified; if Puerto Ricans voted to have a different political status, a second referendum would determine whether Puerto Rico would become a U.S. state, an independent country, or a sovereign nation associated with the U.S. that would not be subject to the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.[135] During the House debate, a fourth option, to retain its present form of commonwealth (sometimes referred to as \"the status quo\") political status, was added as an option in the second plebiscite.[135][136]",
            "Manifest destiny\nThe acquisition of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines after the war with Spain marked a new chapter in U.S.\u00a0history. Traditionally, territories were acquired by the United States for the purpose of becoming new states on equal footing with already existing states. These islands, however, were acquired as colonies rather than prospective states. The process was validated by the Insular Cases. The Supreme Court ruled that full constitutional rights did not automatically extend to all areas under American control. Nevertheless, in 1917, Puerto Ricans were all made full American citizens via the Jones Act. This also provided for a popularly elected legislature, a bill of rights and authorized the election of a Resident Commissioner who has a voice (but no vote) in Congress.",
            "Culture of Puerto Rico\nAnother issue splitting national identity is political ideals on Puerto Rico's national status. There are three primary positions: pro-Commonwealth, pro-statehood, and pro-independence. Basically, Puerto Rican identity has been developed in rejection to American cultural identity.[13] Since United States citizenship was instated, about half of the pre-Commonwealth population of Puerto Rico has relocated to the continental United States.[14] Those who have relocated to the United States are considered by some not to be a part of the Puerto Rican nation.[15]",
            "Political status of Puerto Rico\nThe Supreme Court later made other rulings. For example, in Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 305 (1922), explained the distinction between an incorporated and a non-incorporated territory. Juan R. Torruella restated it this way, \"an unincorporated territory is a territory as to which, when acquired by the United States, no clear intention was expressed that it would eventually be incorporated into the Union as a State\".[29]"

She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".  She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday.  The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do.  Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band \u2013 only to find them delighted with her performance.[41][42]  Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track.[4]  For her contribution she was paid \u00a330, equivalent to about \u00a3360 in 2018,[41][43] but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship.  The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[44][45]  All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.[46]",

In 2005, prior to a hearing in the High Court, an out-of-court settlement was reached.

Among the questions, they were asked \"Are you afraid of dying?\" The responses of doorman Gerry O'Driscoll and the wife of their road Manager Peter Watts were used, as well as other spoken parts throughout the album (\"I've always been mad\" \"That geezer was cruisin' for a bruisin\")",

In its final version, \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was performed live from 1973\u20131975, and from 1987\u20131994. During the band's 1974\u20131975 tour, David Gilmour played both pedal steel guitar and the Hammond organ, allowing Richard Wright to concentrate solely on piano (his keyboards were arranged where he couldn't play both). Gilmour's pedal steel for \"Great Gig\" was located accordingly beside Wright's Hammond. Starting in 1987, additional touring keyboardist Jon Carin took over the Hammond parts. Up to three singers performed the vocals, each taking different parts of the song. On the 1974\u201375 tour, vocal duties were handled by Venetta Fields and Carlena Williams, both former members of The Blackberries.[19]",

            "The Great Gig in the Sky\nThe band played the instrumental track for Torry and asked her to improvise a vocal. At first, Torry struggled to divine what the band wanted, but then she was inspired to pretend that she herself was an instrument.[5] She performed two complete takes, the second one more emotional than the first. David Gilmour asked for a third take, but halfway through Torry stopped, feeling she was getting repetitive and had already done the best she could. The final album track was assembled from all three takes. The members of the band were deeply impressed by Torry's performance, but were so reserved in their outward response that she left under the impression that her vocals would never make the final cut.[6] She only became aware they were used when she saw the album at a local record store, spotted her name in the credits and purchased it.[7]",
            "The Great Gig in the Sky\nThe song began life as a Richard Wright chord progression, known variously as \"The Mortality Sequence\" or \"The Religion Song\". During 1972 it was performed live as a simple organ instrumental, accompanied by spoken-word samples from the Bible and snippets of speeches by Malcolm Muggeridge, a British writer known for his conservative religious views. When the band came to record Dark Side in 1973, the lead instrument had been switched to a piano. Various sound effects were tried over the track, including recordings of NASA astronauts communicating on space missions, but none were satisfactory. Finally, a couple of weeks before the album was due to be finished, the band thought of having a female singer \"wail\" over the music.[2]",

On 4 November 1973, Clare also sang \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" at the Rainbow Theatre in London. [2][3][4][5]",

She had to be told not to sing any words: when she first started, she was doing \"Oh yeah baby\" and all that kind of stuff, so she had to be restrained on that. But there was no real direction \u2013 she just had to feel it.[10]",

Alan had worked with her previously, so we gave her try. And she was fantastic. We had to encourage her a little bit. We gave her some dynamic hints: \"Maybe you'd like to do this piece quietly, and this piece louder.\" She did maybe half a dozen takes, and then afterwards we compiled the final performance out of all the bits. It wasn't done in one single take.[11]",

Both Waters and David Gilmour had each attempted to sing the song on separate takes, as well as on a duet version (available on the 2011 Experience and Immersion editions of Wish You Were Here), but they were unhappy with the results. Harper was recording his album HQ in Studio 2 of Abbey Road at the same time as Pink Floyd were working in Studio 3, and Roy Harper offered to sing the part as Gilmour has already provided some guitar licks for Roy (\"...for a price\").[7] The song is one of only two songs by the band which is not sung by one of their permanent members, the other being \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".",

They played a series of shows in Los Angeles at The Gig and The Mint and broke up in 2001 just before releasing their first album. She then recorded and performed as a backup vocalist for Jennifer Stills and as a backup vocalist for Kathleen Bird York (known for her Oscar-nominated song \"In the Deep\" from Crash). Abizaid began recording vocal sessions for several TV shows with writers Stephen Phillips and Tim P. from Bosshouse Music, as well as two songs for the film Devious Beings in 2002, starring Patrick van Horn and Kevin Connolly.

            "Neil Gaiman\nOne of Gaiman's most commented-upon friendships is with the musician Tori Amos, a Sandman fan who became friends with Gaiman after making a reference to \"Neil and the Dream King\" on her 1991 demo tape. He included her in turn as a character (a talking tree) in his novel Stardust.[127] Amos also mentions Gaiman in her songs, \"Tear in Your Hand\" (\"If you need me, me and Neil'll be hangin' out with the dream king. Neil says hi by the way\"),[128] \"Space Dog\" (\"Where's Neil when you need him?\"),[129] \"Horses\" (\"But will you find me if Neil makes me a tree?\"),[130] \"Carbon\" (\"Get me Neil on the line, no I can't hold. Have him read, 'Snow, Glass, Apples' where nothing is what it seems\"),[131] \"Sweet Dreams\" (\"You're forgetting to fly, darling, when you sleep\"),[132] and \"Not Dying Today\" (\"Neil is thrilled he can claim he's mammalian, 'but the bad news,' he said, 'girl you're a dandelion'\").[131] He also wrote stories for the tour book of Boys for Pele and Scarlet's Walk, a letter for the tour book of American Doll Posse, and the stories behind each girl in her album Strange Little Girls. Amos penned the introduction for his novel Death: the High Cost of Living, and posed for the cover. She also wrote a song called \"Sister Named Desire\" based on his Sandman character, which was included on his anthology, Where's Neil When You Need Him?.",
            "Eva Cassidy\nBefore Christmas of 2000, Top Of The Pops 2 aired a video of Cassidy performing \"Over the Rainbow\", which resulted in Songbird climbing steadily up the UK charts over the next few weeks. Just as ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald aired a feature on Cassidy, the album topped the chart.[21] Shot at Blues Alley by a friend with a camcorder the same night the album was recorded,[2] the video became the most requested video ever shown on Top Of The Pops 2.[22] \"There's an undeniable emotional appeal in hearing an artist who you know died in obscurity singing a song about hope and a mystical world beyond everyday life\", wrote The Guardian.[23]",
            "Wet Wet Wet\nClark and Cunningham met on the school bus and became close friends. Mutual friend Neil Mitchell, prompted by his pals' positive attitude, promised to supply keyboards when he could scrape together enough money from his paper round. To complete the quartet, Clark approached Mark McLachlan, who at the time was training to be a painter and decorator. He said, \"At break we all went behind the kitchen for a fly smoke, and there in the corner was this quiet kid who said very little, but when he sang, everyone listened.\"[6] It was sometime in 1983 that Graeme Duffin joined Wet Wet Wet. He was previously in a 1970s Glasgow-based band called \"New Celeste\", who produced three albums before they broke up. The band combined folk, rock and jazz players.[7]",
            "The Who\nThe band went back on tour, and \"Baba O' Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" became live favourites.[148][149] In November they performed at the newly opened Rainbow Theatre in London for three nights,[150] continuing in the US later that month, where Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times described the Who as \"the Greatest Show on Earth\".[151] The tour was slightly disrupted at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on 12 December when Moon passed out over his kit after overdosing on brandy and barbiturates.[152] He recovered and completed the gig, playing to his usual strength.[153]",
            "Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds\nFor the High Flying Birds touring band, Gallagher recruited keyboardist Mike Rowe and drummer Jeremy Stacey, both of whom continued their roles from the album sessions. Former The Zutons bassist Russell Pritchard, upon hearing that Gallagher had recorded an album and was putting together a band, got in touch and offered his services. David McConnell of The Sand Band was originally chosen for the lead guitarist role[14] but dropped out four weeks before the band's first show; American musician Tim Smith, whom Rowe and Stacey had known from their time together as part of Sheryl Crow's backing band, was hired as the new guitarist.[15]",
            "The Man Who Sold the World\nThe song was covered by the Scottish singer Lulu in 1974, who, according to biographer David Buckley, performed it in \"a sleazy, almost Berlin cabaret style\".[6] Lulu would recall Bowie inviting her to a concert he gave after which he met her in his hotel room saying: \"I want to make an MF of a record with you [because] you're a great singer.\" Lulu - \"I didn't think it would happen but [Bowie] followed up two days later. He was \u00c3\u00bcbercool at the time and I just wanted to be led by him. I loved everything he did. I didn't think 'The Man Who Sold the World' was the greatest song for my voice, but it was such a strong song in itself. I had no idea what it was about. In the studio Bowie kept telling me to smoke more cigarettes, to give my voice a certain quality.\"[7] Bowie produced the Lulu recording of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" with Mick Ronson during the July 1973 Pin Ups sessions and also contributed guitar, saxophone and backing vocals. The remainder of the band included Ronson on guitar, Trevor Bolder on bass, Mike Garson on piano, and Aynsley Dunbar on drums.[8]",
            "Spirit in the Sky\nDuring John Lennon's scathing 1970 Rolling Stone \"Beatles break-up\" interview with Jann S. Wenner, while highly critical of the recent work of many of his peers, including Bob Dylan and ex-band mate Paul McCartney, Lennon professed to liking the then-current radio single, \"Spirit in the Sky\", stating that he \"always liked simple rock and nothing else\".[9]",

            "America (Simon & Garfunkel song)\nDavid Bowie performed a minimalist version of the song to open The Concert for New York City in October 2001. Bowie performed seated on the floor, center stage, with a microphone and a Suzuki Omnichord. Bowie was actually in attendance at the Marquee during 1967 when 1-2-3 (later Clouds) performed this song, and Bowie's New York performance is starkly similar to the quiet solo organ section in the 1-2-3 version. He was a friend of Billy Ritchie, the keyboard player/writer, and the band were also at the time, playing a song by a then-unknown David Bowie, \"I Dig Everything.\"[21]",
            "A Great Day in Harlem (photograph)\nJean Bach, a radio producer of New York, recounted the story behind the photograph in her 1994 documentary film, A Great Day in Harlem. The film was nominated in 1995 for an Academy Award for Documentary Feature. Bach described how, upon the film's release, a number of similar photographs employed the \"A Great Day in...\" theme.[4] Hugh Hefner assembled Hollywood-area musicians for \"A Great Day in Hollywood\" in conjunction with a sneak preview of A Great Day in Harlem.[4] Soon after, \"A Great Day in Philadelphia\" included musicians such as Jimmy Heath, Benny Golson and Ray Bryant.[4] During the filming of Kansas City (1996), musicians including Jay McShann posed for \"A Great Day in Kansas City\".[4] A multi-page supplement in The Star-Ledger featured \"A Great Day in Jersey,\" while a Dutch photograph was titled \"A Great Day in Haarlem.\"[4] In 1998 \"Great Day in St Paul\", was taken by Byron Nelson.[5]",

            "Billy Connolly\nIn 1965, together with Tam Harvey, Connolly started a group called the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, \"My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum.\" The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley.[51] \"Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I\u2019m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I\u2019m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it\u2019s all tricks really. He\u2019s a musician and I\u2019m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do.\"[51] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.",
            "Eyes That See in the Dark\nThe finished instrumental tracks were dubbed onto the demos, and some of the guitar, bass, and synthesizer on the demos is heard in the completed mix. Ron Ziegler had to dub drums exactly in time with the drum machine used on the demos. Some of the musicians had also played on all of Andy Gibb's albums, Tim Renwick, George Terry, and Ron Ziegler. Barry and Maurice Gibb with Albhy Galuten appear both from the demo tracks and new recordings. \"Islands in the Stream\" was not a duet and Rogers was not happy with the recording and only after Dolly Parton was brought in and recorded the song as a duet did the song take off.[3]",
            "Brian Johnson\nJohnson was one of the founding members of the rock band Geordie formed in Newcastle in 1971. After a few hit singles, including UK Top 10 \"All Because of You\" (1973), the band split up in 1978. Following the death of AC/DC lead singer Bon Scott on 19 February 1980, Johnson was asked to audition for the band in London. AC/DC lead guitarist and co-founder Angus Young recalled: \"I remember Bon playing me Little Richard, and then telling me the story of when he saw Brian singing [with Geordie].\" He says about that night: \"There's this guy up there screaming at the top of his lungs and then the next thing you know he hits the deck. He's on the floor, rolling around and screaming. I thought it was great, and then to top it off \u2013 you couldn't get a better encore \u2013 they came in and wheeled the guy off!'\" Johnson was diagnosed with appendicitis later that night, which was the cause of his writhing around on stage.[2] The band agreed immediately that Johnson's performing style fit AC/DC's music. Johnson's first album with AC/DC, Back in Black, became the second all-time best-selling album worldwide according to some estimates. The Guardian ranked the successful transition to Johnson number 36 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history.[3]",

        "docs": [
            "Uniformitarianism\nFrom 1830 to 1833 Charles Lyell's multi-volume Principles of Geology was published. The work's subtitle was \"An attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation\". He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text,[20] and developed Hutton's idea that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. The terms uniformitarianism for this idea, and catastrophism for the opposing viewpoint, were coined by William Whewell in a review of Lyell's book. Principles of Geology was the most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century.",
            "Uniformitarianism\nNone of these connotations requires another, and they are not all equally inferred by uniformitarians.[22]",
            "Uniformitarianism\nAccording to Reijer Hooykaas (1963), Lyell's uniformitarianism is a family of four related propositions, not a single idea:[21]",
            "Uniformitarianism\nUniformitarianism, also known as the Doctrine of Uniformity,[1] is the assumption that the same natural laws and processes that operate in the universe now have always operated in the universe in the past and apply everywhere.[2][3] It refers to invariance in the principles underpinning science, such as the constancy of causality, or causation, throughout time,[4] but it has also been used to describe invariance of physical laws through time and space.[5] Though an unprovable postulate that cannot be verified using the scientific method, uniformitarianism has been a key first principle of virtually all fields of science.[6]",
            "Uniformitarianism\nIn geology, uniformitarianism has included the gradualistic concept that \"the present is the key to the past\" (that events occur at the same rate now as they have always done); many geologists now, however, no longer hold to a strict theory of gradualism.[7] Coined by William Whewell, the word was proposed in contrast to catastrophism[8] by British naturalists in the late 18th century, starting with the work of the geologist James Hutton. Hutton's work was later refined by scientist John Playfair and popularised by geologist Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology in 1830.[9] Today, Earth's history is considered to have been a slow, gradual process, punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events.",
            "Uniformitarianism\nThe two methodological assumptions below are accepted to be true by the majority of scientists and geologists. Gould claims that these philosophical propositions must be assumed before you can proceed as a scientist doing science. \"You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes. It works the other way around.\" You first assume these propositions and \"then you go to the outcrop.\"[24]",
            "Uniformitarianism\nThe current consensus is that Earth's history is a slow, gradual process punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.[43] In practice it is reduced from Lyell's conflation, or blending, to simply the two philosophical assumptions. This is also known as the principle of geological actualism, which states that all past geological action was like all present geological action. The principle of actualism is the cornerstone of paleoecology.",
            "Geology\nSir Charles Lyell first published his famous book, Principles of Geology,[72] in 1830. This book, which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth's history and are still occurring today. In contrast, catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.",
            "Czech Republic\nCyril and Methodius laid the foundations of education and the Czech theological thinking in the 9th century. Original theological and philosophical stream \u2013 Hussitism \u2013 originated in the Middle Ages. It was represented by Jan Hus, Jerome of Prague or Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd. At the end of the Middle Ages, Jan Amos Comenius substantially contributed to the development of modern pedagogy. Jewish philosophy in the Czech lands was represented mainly by Judah Loew ben Bezalel (known for the legend of the Golem of Prague). Bernard Bolzano was the personality of German-speaking philosophy in the Czech lands. Bohuslav Balb\u00edn was a key Czech philosopher and historian of the Baroque era. He also started the struggle for rescuing the Czech language. This culminated in the Czech national revival in the first half of the 19th century. Linguistics (Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd, Pavel Jozef \u0160afa\u0159\u00edk, Josef Jungmann), etnography (Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben, Franti\u0161ek Ladislav \u010celakovsk\u00fd) and history (Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd) played a big role in revival. Palack\u00fd was the eminent personality. He wrote the first synthetic history of the Czech nation. He was also the first Czech modern politician and geopolitician (see also Austro-Slavism). He is often called \"The Father of the Nation\".",
            "Uniformitarianism\nBoth Playfair and Hall wrote their own books on the theory, and for decades robust debate continued between Hutton's supporters and the Neptunists. Georges Cuvier's paleontological work in the 1790s, which established the reality of extinction, explained this by local catastrophes, after which other fixed species repopulated the affected areas. In Britain, geologists adapted this idea into \"diluvial theory\" which proposed repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood.[19]",
            "Uniformitarianism\nModern geologists do not apply uniformitarianism in the same way as Lyell. They question if rates of processes were uniform through time and only those values measured during the history of geology are to be accepted.[40] The present may not be a long enough key to penetrate the deep lock of the past.[41] Geologic processes may have been active at different rates in the past that humans have not observed. \"By force of popularity, uniformity of rate has persisted to our present day. For more than a century, Lyell's rhetoric conflating axiom with hypotheses has descended in unmodified form. Many geologists have been stifled by the belief that proper methodology includes an a priori commitment to gradual change, and by a preference for explaining large-scale phenomena as the concatenation of innumerable tiny changes.\"[42]",

            "An Essay on the Principle of Population\nWhile it was not the first book on population, it was revised for over 28 years and has been acknowledged as the most influential work of its era. Malthus's book fuelled debate about the size of the population in the Kingdom of Great Britain and contributed to the passing of the Census Act 1800. This Act enabled the holding of a national census in England, Wales and Scotland, starting in 1801 and continuing every ten years to the present. The book's 6th edition (1826) was independently cited as a key influence by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in developing the theory of natural selection.",
            "Uniformitarianism\nStephen Jay Gould's first scientific paper, Is uniformitarianism necessary? (1965), reduced these four assumptions to two.[36] He dismissed the first principle, which asserted spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws, as no longer an issue of debate. He rejected the third (uniformity of rate) as an unjustified limitation on scientific inquiry, as it constrains past geologic rates and conditions to those of the present. So, Lyellian uniformitarianism was unnecessary.",
            "Right-wing politics\nRight-wing politics involves in varying degrees the rejection of some egalitarian objectives of left-wing politics, claiming either that social or economic inequality is natural and inevitable or that it is beneficial to society.[49] Right-wing ideologies and movements support social order. The original French right-wing was called \"the party of order\" and held that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.[18] British conservative scholar R. J. White, who rejects egalitarianism, wrote: \"Men are equal before God and the laws, but unequal in all else; hierarchy is the order of nature, and privilege is the reward of honourable service\".[50] American conservative Russell Kirk also rejected egalitarianism as imposing sameness, stating: \"Men are created different; and a government that ignores this law becomes an unjust government for it sacrifices nobility to mediocrity\".[50] Kirk took as one of the \"canons\" of conservatism the principle that \"civilized society requires orders and classes\".[51] Right libertarians reject collective or state-imposed equality as undermining reward for personal merit, initiative and enterprise.[50] In their view, it is unjust, limits personal freedom and leads to social uniformity and mediocrity.[50]",
            "James Hutton\nHutton also advocated uniformitarianism for living creatures \u00a0\u2013 evolution, in a sense\u00a0\u2013 and even suggested natural selection as a possible mechanism affecting them:",
            "Individualism\nLiberalism (from the Latin liberalis, \"of freedom; worthy of a free man, gentlemanlike, courteous, generous\")[27] is the belief in the importance of individual freedom. This belief is widely accepted in the United States, Europe, Australia and other Western nations, and was recognized as an important value by many Western philosophers throughout history, in particular since the Enlightenment. It is often rejected by collectivist, Islamic, or confucian societies in Asia or the Middle East (though Taoists were and are known to be individualists).[28] The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote praising \"the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed\".[29]",
            "Uniformitarianism\nEven Charles Lyell thought that ordinary geological processes would cause Niagara Falls to move upstream to Lake Erie within 10,000 years, leading to catastrophic flooding of a large part of North America.",
            "Majoritarianism\nUnder a democratic majoritarian political structure, the majority would not exclude any minority from future participation in the democratic process. Majoritarianism is sometimes pejoratively referred to by its opponents as \"ochlocracy\" or \"tyranny of the majority\". Majoritarianism is often referred to as majority rule, which may refer to a majority class ruling over a minority class, while not referring to the decision process called majority rule.",
            "Culture of the United Kingdom\nOther important British political figures include William Blackstone, eighteenth-century jurist, judge and politician best known for his seminal work, Commentaries on the Laws of England, containing his formulation: \"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer\", a principle that government and the courts must err on the side of innocence,[269] Emmeline Pankhurst, led the suffragettes which helped win women the right to vote, William Wilberforce, leading parliamentary abolitionist, Robert Peel, founded the Conservative party (which was expanded by Benjamin Disraeli), and created the modern police force.[270] One of the most influential thinkers in the history of liberalism, 19th century philosopher, political economist and politician John Stuart Mill justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control. A member of the Liberal Party, he was also the first Member of Parliament to call for women's suffrage.[271]",

Describing the importance of uniformitarianism on contemporary geology, Lyell wrote,",
            "Sociocultural evolution\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies (1855\u20131936) describes evolution as the development from informal society, where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations, to modern, formal rational society, dominated by traditions and laws, where people are restricted from acting as they wish.[18] He also notes that there is a tendency to standardisation and unification, when all smaller societies are absorbed into a single, large, modern society.[18] Thus T\u00f6nnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as globalization. T\u00f6nnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that social progress is not perfect, and it can even be called a regression as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high cost, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of the individuals making up that society.[18] T\u00f6nnies' work became the foundation of neoevolutionism.[18]",
            "Individualism\nIn the English language, the word \"individualism\" was first introduced, as a pejorative, by the Owenites in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by Saint-Simonianism or came up with it independently.[11] A more positive use of the term in Britain came to be used with the writings of James Elishama Smith, who was a millenarian and a Christian Israelite. Although an early Owenite socialist, he eventually rejected its collective idea of property, and found in individualism a \"universalism\" that allowed for the development of the \"original genius.\" Without individualism, Smith argued, individuals cannot amass property to increase one's happiness.[11] William Maccall, another Unitarian preacher, and probably an acquaintance of Smith, came somewhat later, although influenced by John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle, and German Romanticism, to the same positive conclusions, in his 1847 work \"Elements of Individualism\".[12]",
            "Uniformitarianism\nUniformitarianism was proposed in contrast to catastrophism, which states that the distant past \"consisted of epochs of paroxysmal and catastrophic action interposed between periods of comparative tranquility\"[37] Especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most geologists took this interpretation to mean that catastrophic events are not important in geologic time; one example of this is the debate of the formation of the Channeled Scablands due to the catastrophic Missoula glacial outburst floods. An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history.[38] Derek Ager has noted that \"geologists do not deny uniformitarianism in its true sense, that is to say, of interpreting the past by means of the processes that are seen going on at the present day, so long as we remember that the periodic catastrophe is one of those processes. Those periodic catastrophes make more showing in the stratigraphical record than we have hitherto assumed.\"[39]",
            "Majoritarianism\nAdvocates of majoritarianism argue that majority decision making is intrinsically democratic and that any restriction on majority decision making is intrinsically undemocratic. If democracy is restricted by a constitution which cannot be changed by a simple majority decision then yesterday's majority is being given more weight than today's. If it is restricted by some small group, such as aristocrats, judges, priests, soldiers, or philosophers, then society becomes an oligarchy. The only restriction acceptable in a majoritarian system is that a current majority has no right to prevent a different majority emerging in the future (this could happen, for example, if a minority persuades enough of the majority to change its position). In particular, a majority cannot exclude a minority from future participation in the democratic process. Majoritarianism does not prohibit a decision being made by representatives as long as this decision is made via majority rule, as it can be altered at any time by any different majority emerging in the future.",

On their first stop ashore at St Jago, Darwin found rock formations which -seen \"through Lyell's eyes\"- gave him a revolutionary insight into the geological history of the island, an insight he applied throughout his travels. While in South America, Darwin received Volume 2, which rejected the idea of organic evolution, proposing \"Centres of Creation\" to explain diversity and territory of species. Darwin's ideas gradually moved beyond this, but in geology he operated very much as Lyell's disciple and sent home extensive evidence and theorising supporting Lyell's uniformitarianism, including Darwin's ideas about the formation of atolls.",

It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche to take place.[17] Jung considered individuation to be the central process of human development.[18] In L'individuation psychique et collective, Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending ontological process of individuation. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a \"pre-individual\" left-over, itself making possible future individuations.[19] The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of Gilbert Simondon on individuation and also upon similar ideas in Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. For Stiegler \"the I, as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to we, which is a collective individual.

First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.[141] Similarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that \"democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.\"[142]",

The latter was involved in the Conspiracy of the Equals of 1796 intending to establish a revolutionary regime based on communal ownership, egalitarianism and the redistribution of property.[13] The plot was however detected and he and several others involved were arrested and executed.

Examples include United States magistrate judges, who are appointed by United States district courts, and the Postmaster General of the United States, who is appointed by the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service, which, in turn, is appointed by the president.[3][6]",
            "Federalist No. 69\nThe President of the United States is given the power to appoint public ministers, Supreme Court judges, and all officers established by law. However, the president needs the approval of the Senate in order to appoint any of the listed individuals above. On the other hand, the King of England has the same role of appointing public ministers but is not bounded by any other section of government. Hamilton explains not only is he not bounded by other branches of government, but the King of England is able to appoint public ministers to all offices as well as create offices. The King of England is also enabled to give titles of nobility at his own discretion.[4]",
            "Officer of the United States\nThe difference between an \"Officer of the United States\" and a mere \"Employee of the United States,\" therefore, ultimately rests on whether the office held has been explicitly delegated part of the \"sovereign power of the United States\". Delegation of \"sovereign power\" means possession of the authority to commit the federal government of the United States to some legal obligation, such as by signing a contract, executing a treaty, interpreting a law, or issuing military orders. A federal judge, for instance, has been delegated part of the \"sovereign power\" of the United States to exercise; while a letter carrier for the United States Postal Service has not. Some very prominent title-holders, including the White House Chief of Staff, the White House Press Secretary and most other high-profile presidential staff assistants, are only employees of the United States as they have no authority to exercise the sovereign power of the federal government.[3][1]",
            "Officer of the United States\nWith the exception of military officers and certain court- and board-appointed officers, the method for creating an officer of the United States generally follows a set procedure. First, the Constitution must describe the office, or the U.S. Congress must create the office through a statute (though the president may independently create offices when exercising his exclusive jurisdiction in the exercise of foreign affairs, generally meaning ambassadorships). Second, the president nominates a person to fill the office and then commissions that person at which time the appointee comes to occupy the office and is an officer of the United States. However, if the office is that of ambassador, \"public minister\" (member of the Cabinet of the United States), judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, or if the office has not been specifically vested for filling \"in the President alone\" by the authorizing legislation, then an intermediate step is required before the commission can be issued, namely, the U.S. Senate must give its \"advise and consent\" which, in practice, means approval by vote of a simple majority.[7]",

Once a member of the Board of Governors is appointed by the president, he or she functions mostly independently.  The Board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.[21]  It also supervises and regulates the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks, and the U.S. banking system in general.",

These positions are listed in the Plum Book which outlines more than seven thousand appointive positions in the government. Many of these appointments are made by the president. In the case of ten agencies, the president is free to appoint a new agency head. For example, it is not unusual for the CIA's Director or NASA's Administrator to be changed by the president. Other agencies that deal with federal regulation such as the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission have set terms that will often outlast presidential terms. For example, governors of the Federal Reserve serve for fourteen years to ensure agency independence. The president also appoints members to the boards of directors for government-owned corporations such as Amtrak. The president can also make a recess appointment if a position needs to be filled while Congress is not in session.[33]",

After the president-elect is sworn in, one of his primary obligations is to build his administration. The most publicized of these duties is appointing members of his Cabinet (Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Defense, et cetera).[12] In total, the president makes 6,000 to 9,000 appointments, although he has the right to appoint as many as 700,000 to the federal bureaucracy. Sometimes, a president will allow appointments from the previous administration to maintain their position.[13] \"Normally these appointments include: Cabinet Officers and heads of other executive branch agencies; Under Secretaries; Assistant Secretaries; Directors of Bureaus and Services; and Chairpersons and Members of Boards, Commissions, and Committees.

            "Merit system\nProponents of the system admit that the system does not always lead to the choice of most competent candidate but is effective in eliminating those most incompetent.[4] In addition the possible exclusion of most competent candidate is outweighed by the system's benefits such as limiting the ability of nepotism and political favoritism. The power of appointment being vested in the president of the United States by the United States Constitution, it is not within the power of the United States Congress to fetter the president's action by the enactment of laws restricting the exercise of the power of appointments. Thus, in the United States, the merit system has been extensively applied by the voluntary action of the president following self-imposed rules. It has been judicially determined that the civil-service rules promulgated by the president of the United States do not have the force of general law, and confer upon members of the civil service no right to invoke the aid of the courts to protect them against violation thereof. They are the president's laws, and the president alone can enforce them.[5] Working under the supervision of the president is the Merit Systems Protection Board.

A bishop must be a married high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood. The bishop acts as the presiding high priest of the ward. A bishop simultaneously serves as the president of the Aaronic priesthood and president of the priests quorum in the ward. In a branch, the branch president fulfills the same functions as a bishop; however, a branch president does not need to be a high priest.[5]",

Under said model, known as the separation of powers, the state is divided into different branches. Each branch has separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the others. However, the degree to which the President of the United States has control of Congress often determines his political strength - such as the ability to pass sponsored legislation, ratify treaties, and have Cabinet members and judges approved.",
            "Federal government of the United States\nThe vice president is the second-highest official in rank of the federal government. The office of the vice president's duties and powers are established in the legislative branch of the federal government under Article 1, Section 3, Clauses 4 and 5 as the President of the Senate; this means that he or she is the designated presiding officer of the Senate. In that capacity, the vice president has the authority (ex officio, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College. As first in the U.S. presidential line of succession, the vice president's duties and powers move to the executive branch when becoming president upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president, which has happened nine times in U.S. history. Lastly, in the case of a Twenty-fifth Amendment succession event, the vice president would become acting president, assuming all of the powers and duties of president, except being designated as president. Accordingly, by circumstances, the Constitution designates the vice president as routinely in the legislative branch, or succeeding to the executive branch as president, or possibly being in both as acting president pursuant to the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Because of circumstances, the overlapping nature of the duties and powers attributed to the office, the title of the office and other matters, such has generated a spirited scholarly dispute regarding attaching an exclusive branch designation to the office of vice president.[12][13]",

            "United States Naval Academy\nBy an Act of Congress passed in 1903, two midshipman appointments were allowed for each senator, representative, and delegate in Congress, two for the District of Columbia, and five each year at large. Currently each member of Congress and the Vice President can have five appointees attending the Naval Academy at any time. When any appointee graduates or otherwise leaves the academy, a vacancy is created. Candidates are nominated by their senator, representative, or delegate in Congress, and those appointed at large are nominated by the Vice President. The applicants do not have to know their Congressman to be nominated. Congressmen generally nominate ten people per vacancy. They can nominate people in a competitive manner, or they can have a principal nomination. In a competitive nomination, all ten applicants are reviewed by the academy, to see who is the most qualified. If the congressman appoints a principal nominee, then as long as that candidate is physically, medically, and academically found qualified by the academy, he or she will be admitted, even if there are more qualified applicants. The degree of difficulty in obtaining a nomination varies greatly according to the number of applicants in a particular state. The process of obtaining a nomination typically consists of completing an application, completing one or more essays, and obtaining one or more letters of recommendation and often requires an interview either in person or over the phone. These requirements are set by the respective senator or congressman and are in addition to the USNA application.[84]",

The purpose of the clause is twofold: first, to protect the separation of powers philosophy (upon which the federal frame of government is built); and second, to prevent Congress from conspiring to create offices or increase federal officials' salaries with the expectation that members of Congress would later be appointed to these posts.[5][6]",

As an initial matter, most government employees are not officers and thus are not subject to the Appointments Clause. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that only those appointees \"exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States\" are \"Officers of the United States,\" and hence it is only those who exercise such \"significant authority\" who must be appointed by a mechanism set forth in the Appointments Clause. The Framers of the U.S. constitution did not define the line between principal officers and inferior officers, and the Supreme Court has been content to approach the analysis on a case-by-case basis rather than through a definitive test. The Court listed in Morrison v. Olson (1988) certain factors as hallmarks of \"inferior Officer\" status, such as removability by a higher executive branch official other than the President, and limitations on the officer's duties, jurisdiction, and tenure. In Edmond v. United States (1997) the Court stated that \"\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinferior Officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" Among those officers recognized as \"inferior\" are district court clerks, federal supervisors of elections, the Watergate Special Prosecutor, and an Independent Counsel appointed under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.[8]",

Checks and Balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place. This is based on the idea that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but to give the various branches the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches.[15] They guarantee that the powers of the State have the same weight (co-equal), that is, to be balanced, so that they can limit each other, avoiding the abuse of state power. the origin of checks and balances, like separation of powers itself, is specifically credited to Montesquieu in the Enlightenment (in The Spirit of the Laws, 1748), under this influence was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States.",

Scott claimed he outranked Gaines because Scott's brevet rank of major general, dated July 25, 1814 made him senior to Gaines, whose brevet was dated August 15, 1814. Gaines argued that he should be senior; his and Scott's promotions to brigadier general, colonel, and lieutenant colonel were all issued on the same dates, but Gaines had been promoted to major while Scott was still a captain.

The U.S. Army did not conquer Canada but it did destroy Native American resistance to expansion in the Old Northwest and it validated its independence by stopping two major British invasions in 1814 and 1815. After taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, the U.S. Army seized parts of western Upper Canada, burned York and defeated Tecumseh, which caused his Western Confederacy to collapse. Following U.S. victories in the Canadian province of Upper Canada, British troops who had dubbed the U.S. Army \"Regulars, by God!\", were able to capture and burn Washington, which was defended by militia, in 1814. The regular army, however proved they were professional and capable of defeating the British army during the invasions of Plattsburgh and Baltimore, prompting British agreement on the previously rejected terms of a status quo ante bellum. Two weeks after a treaty was signed (but not ratified), Andrew Jackson defeated the British in the Battle of New Orleans and Siege of Fort St. Philip, and became a national hero. U.S. troops and sailors captured HMS Cyane, Levant and Penguin in the final engagements of the war.

            "Canada under British rule\nIn the War of 1812, the Canadas were once again a battleground, this time between the British and the relatively young United States.[7] During the war, unsuccessful attempts were made by the Americans to invade Upper Canada, after overestimating the amount of support they would receive from Canadian colonists. Many of the inhabitants of Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) were Americans who had very recently arrived in the colony, and some of them did support the invading force; however, the rest of the population was made up of the descendants of Loyalists or the original French colonists, who did not want to be part of the United States. The first American invasion came in October 1812, but they were defeated by General Isaac Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights. The Americans invaded again in 1813, capturing Fort York (now Toronto). Later in the year, the Americans took control of the Great Lakes after the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames, but they had much less success in Lower Canada, where they were defeated at the Battle of Ch\u00e2teauguay and the Battle of Crysler's Farm. The Americans were driven out of Upper Canada in 1814 after the Battle of Lundy's Lane, although they still controlled the Great Lakes and defeated the British at the Battle of Lake Champlain. In English Canada, it is seen as a victory against American invasions, with heroic legends surrounding many of the participants (such as Isaac Brock and Laura Secord) and battles (especially those in the Niagara Peninsula).",

The September 1812 battle represented the first land victory of the war for the American forces, for which Taylor received wide praise, as well as a brevet (temporary) promotion to the rank of major. According to Eisenhower, this represented the first brevet ever awarded in United States history.[26] Later that year, Taylor joined General Samuel Hopkins as an aide on two expeditions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe first into the Illinois Territory and the second to the Tippecanoe battle site, where they were forced to retreat in the Battle of Wild Cat Creek.[27] Taylor moved his growing family to Fort Knox after the violence subsided. In spring 1814, he was called back into action under Brigadier General Benjamin Howard, and after Howard fell sick Taylor led a 430-man expedition from St. Louis, Missouri up the Mississippi River. In the Battle of Credit Island, Taylor defeated Indian forces, but retreated after the Indians were joined by their British allies.[28] That October he supervised the construction of Fort Johnson near present-day Warsaw, Illinois, the last toehold of the U.S. Army in the upper Mississippi River Valley. Upon Howard's death a few weeks later, Taylor was ordered to abandon the fort and retreat to St. Louis. Reduced to the rank of captain when the war ended in 1815, he resigned from the army. He re-entered it a year later after gaining a commission as a major.[29]",
            "War of 1812\nThe Northwest Territory, which consisted of the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, was the battleground for conflict between the Native American Nations and the United States.[37] The British Empire had ceded the area to the United States in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, both sides ignoring the fact that the land was already inhabited by various Native American nations. These included the Miami, Winnebago, Shawnee, Fox, Sauk, Kickapoo, Delaware and Wyandot. Some warriors, who had left their nations of origin, followed Tenskwatawa, the Shawnee Prophet and the brother of Tecumseh. Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"children of the Evil Spirit\": the American settlers.[38] The Indians wanted to create their own state in the Northwest to end the American threat forever as it became clear that the Americans wanted all of the land in the Old Northwest for themselves.[39] Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion. The British saw the Native American nations as valuable allies and a buffer to its Canadian colonies and provided arms. Attacks on American settlers in the Northwest further aggravated tensions between Britain and the United States.[40] Raiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; Westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.[41] British policy towards the Indians of the Northwest was torn between the desire to keep the Americans fighting in the Northwest, and to preserve a region that provided rich profits for Canadian fur traders, versus the fear that too much support for the Indians would cause a war with the United States.[39] Through Tecumseh's plans for an Indian state in the Northwest would benefit British North America by making it more defensible, at the same time, the defeats suffered by Tecumseh's confederation had the British leery of going too far to support what was probably a losing cause. In the months running up to the war, British diplomats attempted to defuse tensions on the frontier.[39]",

Although the war with the British was ultimately a stalemate, the United States was more successful on the western front. Tecumseh was killed by Harrison's army at the Battle of the Thames, ending the resistance in the Old Northwest. The Creeks who fought against the United States were defeated.

The British planned to set up an Indian nation in what is now the Ohio-Wisconsin area to block further American expansion.[12] The U.S. protested and finally, in 1812, went to war. Most Indian tribes, especially those allied with Tecumseh, supported the British and were ultimately defeated by General William Henry Harrison. The War of 1812 became caught up in internal Native American rivalries as well; the Creek War was in part an internal conflict as well as one in which some of the nation allied with the United States and other bands allied with the British.

He was an important caudillo, military general and regional leader, who effectively controlled the Mexican state of Tamaulipas as governor.[1] In borderlands history he is known for leading a paramilitary mounted Mexican Militia in the failed Cortina Wars. The \"Wars\" were raids targeting Anglo-American civilians whose settlement Cortina opposed near the several leagues of land granted to his wealthy family on both sides of the Rio Grande. Anglo families began immigrating to the Lower Rio Grande Valley after the Mexican Army was defeated by the Anglo-Mexican rebels of the Mexican State of Tejas, in the Texas Revolution.

However, Cortina's Mexican militia was easily defeated and forced to flee into Mexico when the Texas Rangers, the United States Army and the local militia of Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Tamaulipas.

Edmund Hogan was a wealthy land owner, judge and Speaker of the House of the territorial legislature whose previous military service included 90 days service in the Missouri Ranger Companies during the War of 1812 and an 1814 appointment as Captain of the 1st Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Missouri Territorial Militia Regiment (Arkansas County).[81] Hogan was probably born in Anson County, North Carolina, in 1780 and grew up in Georgia. Early biographer, Josiah Shinn indicated that Hogan had lived in Pulaski County Georgia, he served as a tax collector, sheriff, state legislator, and a lieutenant colonel in the Georgia militia, however there is reason to question these alleged early accomplishments.[82][83] The date of his settlement in the Missouri Territory is somewhat unclear, as is the nature of his service during the War of 1812. Many early sources give his arrival in the area that would become Little Rock as about 1814, which seems to correspond with his appointment as a captain in the Territorial Militia of Arkansas County, however it appears that he was at least present in the Missouri Territory, if not the District of Arkansas prior to this appointment. There is evidence that Hogan may have originally settled in the District of Cape Girardeau in what is now southeast Missouri, before moving south to the area that would become Arkansas County. In 1798, Hogan owned a farm in the District of Cape Girardeau, across the Mississippi River, from Thebes, Illinois.[84] In 1803, Edmund Hogan is listed among the heads of households in the Cape Girardeau District of the Louisiana Territory, at the time of the Louisiana Purchase by the United States from France.[85] In 1806, he was appointed as a commissioner to help establish the city of Cape Girardeau.[86] He was appointed as a Justice of the Peace for Cape Girardeau on July 8, 1806. His name appears on a September 9, 1811 petition signed by inhabitants of the Territory of Louisiana, asking that Congress pass a Law to admit the area to the Second grade of Territorial Government, which will entitle them to a delegate in Congress. Some of the names on the petition are annotated as residing in the District of Arkansas, but Hogan's is not.[87] Noted Arkansas Historian Margaret Smith Ross, in a 1956 study of squatters rights in early Pulaski County, Arkansas concluded that Edmund Hogan was present in Pulaski County as early as 1812.[84]",
            "Siege of Detroit\nIn the early months of 1812 as tension with Britain increased, many people including William Hull, Governor of the Michigan Territory, urged President of the United States James Madison and Secretary of War William Eustis to form an army which would secure the former Northwest Territory against Native Americans incited to take arms against the United States by British agents and fur trading companies. In particular it was urgently necessary to reinforce the outpost of Detroit, which had a population of 800 but a peacetime garrison of only 120 soldiers.[3] It was also suggested that this army might invade the western districts of Upper Canada, where support might be expected from the many recent immigrants from the United States who had been attracted by generous land grants.[4]",

The land for the fort, at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers, was acquired in 1805 by Zebulon Pike. When concerns mounted about the fur trade in the area, construction of the fort began in 1819.[39] Construction was completed in 1825, and Colonel Josiah Snelling and his officers and soldiers left their imprint on the area. One of the missions of the fort was to mediate disputes between the Ojibwe and the Dakota tribes. Lawrence Taliaferro was an agent of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. He spent 20 years at the site, finally resigning in 1839.[40][41]",

            "Canadian identity\nCanadian historians in recent decades look at the war as a defeat for the First Nations of Canada, and also for the merchants of Montreal (who lost the fur trade of the Michigan-Minnesota area).[50] The British had a long-standing goal of building a \"neutral\" but pro-British Indian buffer state in the American Midwest.[51][52] They demanded a neutral Indian state at the peace conference in 1814 but failed to gain any of it because they had lost control of the region in the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames in 1813, where Tecumseh was killed. The British then abandoned the Indians south of the lakes. The royal elite of (what is now) Ontario gained much more power in the aftermath and used that power to repel American ideas such as democracy and republicanism, especially in those areas of Ontario settled primarily by Americans. Many of those settlers returned to the states and were replaced by immigrants from Britain who were imperial-minded.[53] W. L. Morton says the war was a \"stalemate\" but the Americans \"did win the peace negotiations.\"[54] Arthur Ray says the war made \"matters worse for the native people\" as they lost military and political power.[55] Bumsted says the war was a stalemate but regarding the Indians \"was a victory for the American expansionists.\"[56] Thompson and Randall say \"the War of 1812's real losers were the Native peoples who had fought as Britain's ally.\"[57] On the other hand, the \"1812 Great Canadian Victory Party will bring the War of 1812...to life,\" promised the sponsors of a festival in Toronto in November 2009.[58]",

At the time, militia officers were expected to pay their own expenses. He had married Elizabeth Paxton and inherited his father's land, but he was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service.[9] Their children were born on his family's plantation near Timber Ridge Church, including Sam Houston on March 2, 1793, the fifth of nine children and the fifth son. The senior Samuel and Elizabeth's children were Paxton (b. 1783), Robert (b. 1787), James (b. 1788), John Paxton (b. 1790; first clerk of Izard County, Arkansas, 1819\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1838), Samuel (b. 1793), William (b. 1794), Isabella (b. 1796), Mary Blair (b. 1797), and Elizabeth Ann (b. 1800).

He was honorably discharged from the army on June 15, 1815, and on December 2 following was reinstated as a captain in the Eighth Infantry with the brevet of major. On June 1, 1816, he was promoted to his majority and transferred to the Seventh Infantry. In 1818 he was in charge of the recruiting station at Philadelphia securing recruits for the Seminole War in Florida.

            "Military history of the United States\nBy far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812.[16] With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.[17]",
            "History of modern literature\nNorth Americans who would later produce great literature were being born in the first third of the century. In 1803 the great American poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson was born (May 25) in Boston and in 1804 Nathaniel Hawthorne. In 1807 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and then Edgar Allan Poe in 1809. Phillipe-Ignace Fran\u00e7ois Aubert du Gaspe, author of the first French Canadian novel was born in 1814 followed by Henry David Thoreau in 1817 and Herman Melville in 1819. Canadian poets Octave Cr\u00e9mazie and James McIntyre were both born in 1827. In 1830 was the birth of Emily Dickinson and, just over a third of the way through the century, in 1835 Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) arrived in this world. Before all of them was Washington Irving, said to be the first American \"Literary Lion\" and mentor to several other American writers. Washington Irving wrote \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" (a short story contained in his collection The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.) while he was living in Birmingham, England and it was first published in 1819."

The Fair Copy was sent to John Dunlap to be printed under the title \"A Declaration by the Representatives of the united states of america, in General Congress assembled.\" Boyd argued that if a document was signed in Congress on July 4, it would have been the Fair Copy, and probably would have been signed only by John Hancock with his signature being attested by Thomson.[11]",

Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4.[103] But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.[104]",

            "United States Declaration of Independence\nThe document signed by Congress and enshrined in the National Archives is usually regarded as the Declaration of Independence, but historian Julian P. Boyd argued that the Declaration, like Magna Carta, is not a single document. Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts, as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by John Dunlap of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in The National Archives in England in 2009.[132]",

When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang.[21][22][23] However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing.[22] According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the National Park Service, \"We do not know whether or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence.\"[24]",

Independence was declared on July 4, 1776; the preparation of a plan of confederation was postponed. Although the Declaration was a statement of principles, it did not create a government or even a framework for how politics would be carried out. It was the Articles of Confederation that provided the necessary structure to the new nation during and after the American Revolution.

            "National Football League Christmas games\nIn 2007, Christmas Eve landed on a Monday. This proved especially problematic; the league's television contract with ESPN requires the league to provide 17 Monday Night Football games over the course of the first 16 weeks of the season (the league no longer schedules a Monday night game for the final weekend of the season, for multiple reasons). In seasons past, the league compensated for an instance like this by giving ESPN or ABC an extra Saturday or Thursday night game later in the season, but this was no longer possible because the new television contract gave the rights to those games to NFL Network. Thus, with the league already stretching its limits by placing a Monday night doubleheader on opening weekend, this meant that every available Monday night would have to air at least one game, even if it were Christmas Eve. To ease the issue, the game was scheduled between two Western teams, the Denver Broncos at the San Diego Chargers, so that the game could start at 5:00 PM local time. The same scenario was set to occur in 2012, but the NFL's newly renegotiated television rights returned the rights to occasional Saturday night games to ESPN, which allowed them to move the scheduled \"Monday night\" game for that week to the Saturday before (the Saturday night game in 2012 would feature the Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was during this game that Detroit's Calvin Johnson surpassed Jerry Rice's 1,848 yard single season receiving record from 1995).",

Other than show star David Cassidy (and star Shirley Jones on a couple of songs), none of the actors participated in singing or playing the songs; on camera they lip-synced and pretended to play instruments while the soundtrack is actually recordings by session musicians. Ward was in the Ron Hicklin Singers vocal group, along with brothers John Bahler and Tom Bahler, and Ron Hicklin. With Cassidy singing lead, this group did all the TV show performances and records credited to the Partridge Family (along with session instrumental musicians who became known as the Wrecking Crew). Since the public did not know who really created the many Partridge Family songs that became big hits, Ward again was anonymous.",

Her real-life 20-year-old stepson David Cassidy, who was an unknown actor at the time, played Shirley Partridge's eldest son Keith and became a teen idol. The show also spawned a number of albums and singles by The Partridge Family, performed by David Cassidy and Shirley Jones. That same year, \"I Think I Love You\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart, making Jones the second person, after Frank Sinatra, and the first woman to win an acting Oscar and also have a number-one hit on that chart, an achievement only matched by Cher and Barbra Streisand (Cher had already topped the singles chart with I Got You Babe in 1965, but did not win her Oscar until 1987). The Partridge Family won a NARM award for the best-selling single of the year in 1970 for their hit \"I Think I Love You\".[10] In 1971, The Partridge Family was nominated for a Grammy under the Best New Artist category.[11]",

            "Postage stamp\nArtists, designers, engravers and administrative officials are involved with the choice of subject matter and the method of printing stamps. Early stamp images were almost always produced from engravings \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a design etched into a steel die, which was then hardened and whose impression was transferred to a printing plate. Using an engraved image was deemed a more secure way of printing stamps as it was nearly impossible to counterfeit a finely detailed image with raised lines unless you were a master engraver. In the mid-20th century, stamp issues produced by other forms of printing began to emerge, such as lithography, photogravure, intaglio and web offset printing. These later printing methods were less expensive and typically produced images of lesser quality.",
            "Self-adhesive stamp\nThe United States Postal Service's first foray into self-adhesive stamps was in 1974 with the 10-cent dove weathervane,[1] produced by Avery Dennison,[3] that soon became discolored due to the instability of the adhesive. It was another 15 years (1989) before another such stamp was issued by the USPS.[2] Stamp collectors criticized the format, as the rubber base adhesive used tended to progressively yellow the stamps. They also found them difficult to remove from covers,[2] and to save in mint condition, though self-adhesives of recent years have improved in these respects. The British Post Office first issued self-adhesive stamps on October 19, 1993, with the introduction of books of 20 First Class stamps, later a 2nd class stamp was introduced. In later years other issues were produced in the self-adhesive format. Die cutting tools for the UK self adhesive stamps were manufactured by Arden Dies of Stockport, Cheshire using tools designed by Robert Clapham.[citation needed] Outside of the philatelic community, the stamps have been welcomed as more convenient; by 2002, virtually all new USPS stamps were issued as self-adhesives.[2]",
            "Postage stamp\nPostage stamps have facilitated the delivery of mail since the 1840s. Before then, ink and hand-stamps (hence the word 'stamp'), usually made from wood or cork, were often used to frank the mail and confirm the payment of postage. The first adhesive postage stamp, commonly referred to as the Penny Black, was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840. The invention of the stamp was part of an attempt to reform and improve the postal system in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,[1] which, in the early 19th century, was in disarray and rife with corruption.[2] There are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the stamp.[3]",
            "Postage stamps and postal history of the United States\nThe issue and use of adhesive postage stamps continued during the 19th century primarily for first class mail. Each of these stamps generally bore the face or bust of an American president or another historically important statesman. However, once the Post Office realized during the 1890s that it could increase revenues by selling stamps as \"collectibles,\" it began issuing commemorative stamps, first in connection with important national expositions, later for the anniversaries of significant American historical events. Continued technological innovation subsequently prompted the introduction of special stamps, such as those for use with airmail, zeppelin mail, registered mail, certified mail, and so on.[citation needed] Postage due stamps were issued for some time and were pasted by the post office to letters having insufficient postage with the postage due to be paid to the postal carrier at the receiving address.",
            "Presidents of the United States on U.S. postage stamps\nThe paper postage stamp itself was born of utility (in England, 1840), as something simple and easy to use was needed to confirm that postage had been paid for an item of mail. People could purchase several stamps at one time and no longer had to make a special trip to pay for postage each time an item was mailed. The postage stamp design was usually printed from a fine engraving and were almost impossible to forge adequately. This is where the appearance of presidents on stamps was introduced. Moreover, the subject theme of a president, along with the honors associated with it, is what began to define the stamp issues in ways that took it beyond the physical postage stamp itself and is why people began to collect them. There exist entire series of stamp issues whose printing was inspired by the subject alone.",

It was not considered successful, and the surviving stamps, though not rare, are all gradually becoming discolored due to the adhesive used. Self-adhesives were not issued again until 1989, gradually becoming so popular that as of 2004[update], only a handful of types are offered with the traditional gum (now affectionately called \"manual stamps\" by postal employees).",

Sir Rowland Hill reformed the postal system based on the concepts of penny postage and prepayment.[14] In his proposal Hill also called for official pre-printed envelopes and adhesive postage stamps as alternative ways of getting the sender to pay for the postage, at a time when prepayment was optional, which led to the invention of the postage stamp, the Penny Black.",

The postage for the mailed item was prepaid by the use of a hand-stamp to frank the mailed item, confirming payment of postage.

These are inevitably diecut, meaning that the stamps themselves are cut entirely apart, held together only by the backing paper. At first the backing paper was itself solid, but in a repeat of history, is now slightly rouletted so as to facilitate tearing off blocks of stamps without having to remove them from the backing. Since the diecut goes all the way through the stamp, any shape will work, and the original self-adhesives were straight-edged. However, the tradition of perforation is so strong that more recent self-adhesives have a wavy diecut simulating the perforation. It can be recognized by studying the edge of the stamp closely; true perforations will have torn paper fibers on each tooth, while simulated perforations are smooth.",

The Post Office stated that the release took place on June 17. Some sources, however, believe that the stamp was introduced on April 14, the one-year anniversary of Lincoln's death, and one notable expert made an (unverifiable) claim that the stamp first saw use on April 15.[24] In any case, it is considered by some as America's first commemorative stamp. From that point on Lincoln's portrait appeared on a variety of U.S. postage stamps and today exists on more than a dozen issues.

Each stamp was hand engraved in what is believed to be steel, and laid out in sheets of 200 stamps. The 5-cent stamp is often found today with very poor impressions because the type of ink used contained small pieces of quartz that wore down the steel plates used to print the stamp.

            "Postage stamps and postal history of the United States\nCongress finally provided for the issuance of stamps by passing an act on March 3, 1847, and the Postmaster-General immediately let a contract to the New York City engraving firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch, and Edson.[17] The first stamp issue of the U.S. was offered for sale on July 1, 1847, in New York City, with Boston receiving stamps the following day and other cities thereafter. They consisted of an engraved 5-cent red brown stamp depicting Benjamin Franklin (the first postmaster of the U.S.), and a 10-cent value in black with George Washington. Like all U.S. stamps until 1857, they were imperforate.",
            "Louisiana Purchase Exposition\nEarly Fax Machine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The telautograph, the precursor to the modern day fax machine, was invented in 1888 by the American scientist, Elisha Gray who at one point in time contested Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone.[20] The telautograph was a device which could send electrical impulses to the receiving pen of the device, in order to be able to recreate drawings to a piece of paper while a person simultaneously wrote them longhand on the other end of the device. In 1900 Gray's assistant, Foster Ritchie, improved upon the original design and it was this device which was displayed at the 1904 World's Fair and marketed for the next thirty years.[21]",
            "Stamp collecting\nPostage stamp collecting began at the same time that stamps were first issued, and by 1860 thousands of collectors and stamp dealers were appearing around the world as this new study and hobby spread across Europe, European colonies, the United States and other parts of the world.",
            "Postage stamp separation\nAlso in 1854 a \"rotary process\" was patented by William Bemrose and Henry Howe Bemrose. The Bemrose machine was designed as a rouletting machine. As such, it proved impracticable for stamp separation but in 1856 was successfully converted to a perforating machine by George C. Howard of Toppan Carpenter, stamp printers for the American Government.[3] Both the stroke and rotary processes have been refined since then, but are basically still the ones in use in the 21st century. The key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes; if too far apart, the stamps will not separate easily, and the stamps are likely to tear, but if too close, the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling. In a few cases the size of the holes has been a factor. In the case of certain stamps produced by Australia for sale in rolls rather than sheets (coil stamps) a pattern can be seen on the stamp's short side of two small, ten large and two small holes.",
            "Postage stamps and postal history of India\nThe urgent European mails were carried overland via Egypt at the isthmus of Suez. This route, pioneered by Thomas Waghorn,[11] linked the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, and thence by steamer via Marseilles, Brindisi or Trieste to European destinations. The Suez Canal did not open until much later (17 November 1869). The time in transit for letters using the Overland Mail[12] route was dramatically reduced.  Waghorn's route reduced the journey from 16,000 miles via the Cape of Good Hope to 6,000 miles; and reduced the time in transit from three months to between 35 and 45 days.",

            "Bugs Bunny\nIn 1997, Bugs appeared on a U.S. postage stamp, the first cartoon to be so honored, beating the iconic Mickey Mouse. The stamp is number seven on the list of the ten most popular U.S. stamps, as calculated by the number of stamps purchased but not used. The introduction of Bugs onto a stamp was controversial at the time, as it was seen as a step toward the 'commercialization' of stamp art. The postal service rejected many designs and went with a postal-themed drawing. Avery Dennison printed the Bugs Bunny stamp sheet, which featured \"a special ten-stamp design and was the first self-adhesive souvenir sheet issued by the U.S. Postal Service.\"[48]",

Instead he accidentally created a \"low-tack,\" reusable, pressure-sensitive adhesive.[1][2][3] For five years, Silver promoted his \"solution without a problem\" within 3M both informally and through seminars but failed to gain acceptance. In 1974 a colleague who had attended one of his seminars, Art Fry, came up with the idea of using the adhesive to anchor his bookmark in his hymn book.[4][5] Fry then utilized 3M's officially sanctioned \"permitted bootlegging\" policy to develop the idea.[5] The original notes' yellow color was chosen by accident, as the lab next-door to the Post-It team had only yellow scrap paper to use.[6]",
            "Presidents of the United States on U.S. postage stamps\nThe portrayals of various American presidents made their first appearances on U.S. postage at different times for very different reasons. Among the most definitive is George Washington, whose engraving (along with that of Benjamin Franklin) appeared on the first U.S. Postage stamps released by the U.S. Post Office, on July 1 of 1847. Thomas Jefferson first appeared on U.S. postage in March 1856, nine years after the first issues were released. Fifteen years of stamp issuance would pass before Andrew Jackson would appear on a U.S. postage stamp. However, by this time, Jackson had already been presented on two Confederate stamps (both 2-cent values), making him the only U.S. president introduced to postage by the Confederacy rather than the U.S. Post Office. Abraham Lincoln appeared for the first time on a U.S. postage stamp with the issue of 1866, released on April 14, 1866, the first anniversary of his death. Up until this time only the portrayals of Washington, Franklin, Jefferson and Jackson were found on U.S. postage.[1]",

            "Alamo Mission in San Antonio\nThe compound was one of the early Spanish missions in Texas, built for the education of area American Indians after their conversion to Christianity. The mission was secularized in 1793 and then abandoned. Ten years later, it became a fortress housing the Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras military unit, who likely gave the mission the name Alamo. During the Texas Revolution, Mexican General Martin Perfecto de Cos surrendered the fort to the Texian Army in December 1835, following the Siege of B\u00e9xar. A relatively small number of Texian soldiers then occupied the compound for several months. They were wiped out at the Battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. When the Mexican army retreated from Texas several months later, they tore down many of the Alamo walls and burned some of the buildings.",

            "Seguin, Texas\nDuring Reconstruction, the freed slaves in Seguin organized their own congregation, the Second Baptist Church, and, in 1876, a school that came to be known as the Lincoln School. In 1887 they established Guadalupe College, comparable to a junior college today, with a heavy concentration on vocational education. These institutions were begun with the help of Rev. Leonard Ilsley, an abolitionist minister from Maine. But William Baton Ball, himself an ex-slave, Union soldier in the Civil War, and former Buffalo Soldier, became their leader. He was greatly assisted by his friend and benefactor George Brackenridge of San Antonio.

The Nacogdoches settlement was located farther north and east. Tejanos from Nacogdoches traded with the French and Anglo residents of Louisiana, and they were culturally influenced by them. The third settlement was located north of the Rio Grande, toward the Nueces River. The ranchers there were citizens of Spanish origin from Tamaulipas and (what is now) northern Mexico, and they identified with Spanish Criollo culture.[4]",

The settler population was overwhelmingly outnumbered by the indigenous people. To increase settler numbers, Mexico enacted the General Colonization Law in 1824, which enabled all heads of household, regardless of race, religion or immigrant status, to acquire land in Mexico. The first empresarial grant had been made under Spanish control to Stephen F. Austin, whose settlers, known as the Old Three Hundred, settled along the Brazos River in 1822.

While pursuing the Native Americans, in 1797 the Spaniards came upon a fertile valley, which was named Los Vallecitos de San Marcos (Little Valleys of Saint Mark) to honor the day of discovery: April 25, St. Mark\u2019s Day. On April 22, 1840, Governor Juan B. Alvarado granted Rancho Vallecitos de San Marcos to his relative, Jose Mar\u00eda Alvarado. Jose Alvarado was killed at the Pauma Massacre in 1846, and the land was left to his wife; she then sold the land to Lorenzo Soto. In the late 1850s, Soto sold part of his land to Cave Couts, and his family was soon raising livestock.

Jr. (Petty) Wilbury, with drummer Jim Keltner credited as Buster Sidebury. Harrison was no stranger to the use of alternate identities, as he had adopted them with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and with his plethora of pseudonyms as a session musician, including L'Angelo Misterioso, George O'Hara and Hari Georgeson. During the Beatles's first tour of Scotland, in 1960, he had used the pseudonym \"Carl Harrison\", in reference to one of his favourite musicians, Carl Perkins.[3] With the Traveling Wilburys, this concept was taken a step further, since the participants' real names do not appear anywhere on the album, liner notes, or the songwriting credits.",

            "Roy Orbison\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with Electric Light Orchestra bandleader Jeff Lynne on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's Cloud Nine album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on a song of Harrison's new single.[99] They subsequently contacted Bob Dylan, who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to Tom Petty's residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.[100] By that evening, the group had written \"Handle with Care\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys, representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \"Lefty Wilbury\" after Lefty Frizzell.[101] Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"[102]",
            "George Harrison\nAfter Orbison's death in December 1988 the group recorded as a four-piece.[148] Their second release, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3. According to Lynne, \"That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'\"[149] It reached number 14 in the UK, where it went platinum with certified sales of more than 3,000,000 units.[150] The Wilburys never performed live and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album.[151]",

            "Traveling Wilburys\nGeorge Harrison first mentioned the Traveling Wilburys publicly during a radio interview with Bob Coburn on the show Rockline in February 1988.[2] When asked how he planned to follow up the success of his Cloud Nine album, Harrison replied: \"What I'd really like to do next is ... to do an album with me and some of my mates ... It's this new group I got [in mind]: it's called the Traveling Wilburys, I'd like to do an album with them and then later we can all do our own albums again.\"[3][nb 1] According to Jeff Lynne, who co-produced Cloud Nine, Harrison introduced the idea of the two of them starting a band together around two months into the sessions for his album,[5] which began in early January 1987.[6] When discussing who the other members might be, Harrison chose Bob Dylan and Lynne opted for Roy Orbison.[5][7] The term \"Wilbury\" also originated during the Cloud Nine sessions. Referring to recording errors created by faulty equipment, Harrison jokingly remarked to Lynne, \"We'll bury 'em in the mix.\"[8] Thereafter, they used the term for any small error in performance. Harrison first suggested \"the Trembling Wilburys\" as the group's name; at Lynne's suggestion, they amended it to \"Traveling Wilburys\".[2]",
            "Traveling Wilburys\nThe project's work received much anticipation given the diverse nature of the singer-songwriters. Their debut album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 proved an enduring critical success, in 1989 and 1990 winning accolades such as a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.",
            "Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\n\"Handle with Care\" was considered too good to be used as a B-side, so Harrison decided to form a band and record another nine songs for an album.

The band's first song, \"Handle with Care\", was intended as a B-side of one of Harrison's singles, but was judged too good for that purpose and the group decided to record a full album, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. A second Wilburys album, mischievously titled Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3 and recorded without the recently deceased Orbison, followed in 1990. The album was named Vol. 3 as a response to a series of bootlegged studio sessions being sold as Travelling Wilburys Vol. 2. Petty incorporated Traveling Wilburys songs into his live shows, consistently playing \"Handle with Care\" in shows from 2003 to 2006, and for his 2008 tour adding \"surprises\" such as \"End of the Line\" to the set list.[28]",
            "Traveling Wilburys\nThe album was released on 18 October 1988.[47] Distributed by Warner Bros., it appeared on the new Wilbury record label rather than on Harrison's Dark Horse label, in the interests of maintaining the group identity.[42] Over the months following the end of recording in the summer, contractual issues had been successfully negotiated between Warner's and the record companies representing Dylan, Petty, Lynne and Orbison. As was the case in 1971 when EMI prepared Harrison's multi-artist live album from the Concert for Bangladesh for release, Columbia, Dylan's label, presented the main stumbling block.[22][nb 3] In the album credits, the \"Wilburys\" joke was extended further, with the band members listed under various pseudonyms and pretending to be half-brothers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sons of a fictional Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.[48][49] During promotion for the album, Orbison played along with the mock history, saying: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder, but I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"[50][30]",

During 1989 and 1990 the album won many accolades, including a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. The album was also nominated for Album of the Year. In his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin describes the Traveling Wilburys as \"the last of the great supergroups\" and writes of the band's accidental origins: \"This wonderful potpourri of stars reintroduced 'having a good time' to their vocabulary and the result was not a Harrison solo album but the superb debut of the Traveling Wilburys. The outing proved to be a major success, bringing out the best of each artist; in particular, this [album] proved to be the marvellous swan song for Roy Orbison who tragically died soon afterwards.\"[10]",

We could have a great band up there and the four of us could play acoustic if we wanted to. We could all sing \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and Bob could sing \"Something\".

Needing a studio at short notice, Harrison called Bob Dylan, who agreed to let them use his garage studio. After dinner, Harrison stopped by Petty\u2019s house to pick up a guitar he had left there, and invited Petty along too. Gathering at Dylan\u2019s Malibu home the following day, Harrison, Lynne, Orbison and Petty worked on a song that Harrison had started writing for the occasion, \"Handle with Care\". At first, Dylan's role was that of a host, maintaining a barbecue to feed the musicians; at Harrison's invitation, Dylan then joined them in writing lyrics for the song.

Believe it or not, I'm in awe of you guys, and it's the same for me.\"[37] While most of the songs had a primary composer,[38] all of the band members were creative equals.[31] Petty later described Harrison as the Wilburys' \"leader and manager\",[39] and credited him with being a bandleader and producer that had a natural instinct for bringing out the best in people and keeping a recording session productive.[40][nb 2] As the group's producers, Harrison and Lynne directed the sessions, with Harrison often auditioning each member to decide who should sing a particular lead vocal part.[43][44] The two producers then flew back to England; Lynne recalls that, throughout the flight, he and Harrison enthused about how to turn the sparse, acoustic-based tracks into completed recordings.[45] Overdubs and further recording took place at Harrison's studio, FPSHOT,[28] with \"Sideburys\" Jim Keltner (drums), Jim Horn (saxophones) and Ray Cooper (percussion).[22] Harrison described the band's sound as \"skiffle for the 1990s\".[46]",

There, Harrison struck up a musical rapport with Petty based on their shared love of 1950s rock 'n' roll,[13] and Lynne began collaborating with Petty on what became the latter's debut solo album, Full Moon Fever,[14] and writing songs with Orbison, Lynne's longtime musical hero,[15] for his comeback album, Mystery Girl.[16][17] According to Petty, Harrison's dream for the Wilburys was to handpick the participants and create \"the perfect little band\", but the criteria for inclusion were governed most by \"who you could hang out with\".[18] The five musicians also bonded over a shared appreciation of the English comedy troupe Monty Python.[19] Harrison, who had worked with the members of Monty Python on various productions by his company HandMade Films since the late 1970s, particularly appreciated Orbison's gift for impersonation and his ability to recite entire sketches by the troupe.[20][21]",

That, of course, was the key to their charm \u2026\"[51] Speaking to music journalist Paul Zollo in 2004, Petty agreed that humour and self-effacement had been key factors in the Wilburys' success, adding: \"We wanted to make something good in a world that seemed to get uglier and uglier and meaner and meaner \u2026 And I'm really proud that I was part of it.

            "Handle with Care (song)\n\"Handle with Care\" is the first track from the Traveling Wilburys' 1988 album, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1, and the group's most successful single. Writing credits are shared by all five band members: George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan.",
            "Bob Dylan\nThe album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album.[214] Michael Gray wrote: \"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\"[215] The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart,[214] featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.[216] Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.[217]",
            "Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\nReleased October 18, 1988, Volume One became the surprise hit of the year, selling two million copies within six months in the US, reaching No. 3 in the US and No. 16 in the UK. With over 50 weeks on the charts, The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was later certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. While Harrison and Petty had had recent successes, Dylan, Orbison (who died of a sudden heart attack on December 6, 1988) and Lynne had not seen an album climb that high in several years. At the time, no Dylan album had ever achieved two million in sales. As one critic put it, it was \"one of the great commercial coups of the decade\". The single \"Handle with Care\" was a significant hit in the UK charts, peaking at No. 21, and an even bigger hit in Australia (No. 3) and New Zealand (No. 4), though it stalled at No. 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100.",
            "Robert Guillaume\nIn 1964 he portrayed Sportin' Life in a revival of Porgy and Bess at New York's City Center.[3] Guillaume was a member of the Robert de Cormier Singers, performing in concerts and on television.[5] He recorded a LP record, Columbia CS9033, titled Just Arrived as a member of The Pilgrims, a folk trio, with Angeline Butler and Millard Williams.[8] Columbia records producer, Tom Wilson, had set out to create the Pilgrims as an answer to the popular folk trio, Peter, Paul and Mary. By early 1964, the Pilgrims had recorded a handful of songs and Wilson was looking for the right song for the group's debut single when then unknown singer/songwriter, Paul Simon arrived for a meeting with Wilson and eventually pitched his new composition, \"The Sound of Silence\". Wilson liked the song, had Simon record a demo for the group, but when Simon and his friend, Art Garfunkel, sang the song for Wilson in person, he signed them to a record contract instead of using it for The Pilgrims.[12] (In the sixties he was in Vienna, Austria at the Vienna Volksoper, Marcel Prawy engaged Robert Guillaume for the role of Sportin' Life in Porgy and Bess.)[7]",

            "Traveling Wilburys\nIn March 1990, Harrison, Lynne, Petty and Dylan reunited to work on a second Wilburys album, which they intentionally misnumbered Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.[58] It was preceded by a non-album single, a cover of \"Nobody's Child\",[49] which the band recorded for Olivia Harrison's Romanian Angel Appeal charity project.[58][59] The duration of the main album sessions was again dictated by Dylan's touring schedule and limited availability. Having asked Dylan to record a lead vocal for all the songs before his departure, Harrison was then loath to replace many of the parts, resulting in a greater prominence for Dylan as a lead singer.[58] Although he ceded his own role as a lead vocalist to Dylan and to Petty,[60] Harrison took over more of the production and contributed more prominently as a lead guitarist than before.[61] Petty described the album as \"a little more rough and ready, a bit more raucous\" than Vol. 1,[62] while Dylan said the new songs were more developed as compositions relative to the \"scraped up from jam tapes\" approach to the band's debut.[58]",
            "Mister Ed\nThe other main character throughout the series is Wilbur's generally tolerant young wife, Carol (Connie Hines). The Posts also have two sets of neighbors, to whom Ed delights in making Wilbur appear as eccentric as possible. They included the Addisons, Roger (Larry Keating) and his wife Kay (Edna Skinner), who both appeared from the pilot episode until Keating's death in 1963; thereafter, Skinner continued appearing as Kay, without mention of Roger's absence, until the neighbors were recast. During this period, Kay's brother Paul Fenton (Jack Albertson), who had made occasional appearances before, appears. Following the Addisons, the Posts' new neighbors were Col. Gordon Kirkwood, USAF (Ret.), Wilbur's former commanding officer (Leon Ames), and his wife Winnie (Florence MacMichael). They appeared on the series from 1963 to 1965.[2] In the final season, the Kirkwoods were phased out, while Carol's grumpy and uptight father, Mr. Higgins (Barry Kelley), who appeared occasionally throughout the entire series, apparently moved in with Wilbur and Carol during the final episodes. Wilbur and his father-in-law did not get along at all because Mr. Higgins loathed Wilbur, whose quirky eccentricity and klutzy, half-hearted attempts to be friendly always clashed with Mr. Higgins's emotionless and uptight personality. Carol's father never stopped trying to persuade her to divorce Wilbur, whom he often and openly referred to as a \"kook\" because of Wilbur's clumsiness. Alan Young performed double duty during the final season of the series, also directing nearly all episodes."

It was not until Needham's friend Burt Reynolds read the script, and said he would star, that the film was aimed at a more mainstream release; Reed would now portray Bandit's friend Snowman (Reed would eventually play the Bandit in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3). At that time Reynolds was the top box office star in the world. In the original script Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey. Bandit's car was a second generation Ford Mustang and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $80,000.[5]",

            "Buford T. Justice\nIn the first Smokey and the Bandit and Smokey and the Bandit Part II, Sheriff Justice is the primary antagonist to the Bandit (played by Burt Reynolds), while in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 he is the primary protagonist, as Big and Little Enos Burdette challenge him to make a run for them from Miami, Florida to their ranch on the outskirts of Austin, Texas in 24 hours, while carrying a stuffed shark (which is the logo of their \"Fish & Chips\" fast food franchise), for the prize of $250,000. Justice seems to have no love for Big and Little Enos, and doesn't hide it, as their hiring of the Bandit to do their runs in the past had led Buford into many humiliating predicaments while hunting the Bandit, and berates them (especially on Little Enos, attacking him for his small stature).",
            "Smokey and the Bandit Part 3\nAs is the case with the two preceding Smokey and the Bandit films, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 begins with Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams) offering a sizable wager on one's ability to transport a shipment a large distance in a short period of time. Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting $250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.",
            "Smokey and the Bandit Part 3\nUnlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroys their milk truck, which drenches them and disables their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Enthusiastic at the opportunity to portray the Bandit, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.",
            "Smokey and the Bandit Part 3\nThe film was originally entitled Smokey IS the Bandit, and did not include Jerry Reed in the cast. Contemporary newspapers refer to original plans to feature Gleason as both \"Smokey\" and \"Bandit\",[3] and Reed's name does not appear in early promotional materials or newspaper accounts during the film's production. According to some accounts, Jackie Gleason was to play two roles: Sheriff Buford T. Justice and a different \"Bandit\". The original version was shot in October 1982. Reportedly test audiences reacted poorly, finding Gleason's two roles confusing, so the studio opted to do reshoots in April 1983.[4] The Bandit scenes were re-shot with Jerry Reed playing the role. Other accounts indicate that the title was more literal: that Gleason was to play only Sheriff Justice, but the character would also fill the role of \"Bandit\", by taking the Enos family's challenge (as Reynolds' character had done in the previous films).[5] In a teaser trailer for the film (billed as Smokey Is the Bandit), Gleason appears in character as Justice, explaining to the audience that to defeat the Bandit he would adopt the attributes of his prey, \"becoming [my] own worst enemy\". A publicity still of Gleason apparently shows him in costume as the Bandit.[6]",

He gave Needham a preview of the song, and when initially he got no reaction from the director, offered to rewrite the song. Needham, however, liked the song so much he assured Jerry not to change a word. It became one of Reed's biggest hits and his signature song.[8]",
            "Smokey and the Bandit II\nThe film received negative reviews from critics who felt that the original was better. It received an approval rating of 20% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 5 reviews.[3] Roger Ebert gave it a 1 out of 4 stars and stated that there was \"[in 1980] no need for this movie. That's true of most sequels, but it's especially true of 'Smokey and the Bandit II,' which is basically just the original movie done again, not as well\u00c2\u00a0... how can I say it's lazy when it has 50 trucks doing stunts in it?

            "Smokey and the Bandit\nThe theme music, \"East Bound and Down\", was sung and co-written by Reed (credited under his birth name, Jerry Hubbard) and Dick Feller. It became Reed's signature song and is found on multiple albums, including Country Legends and his live album Jerry Reed: Live Still. In 1991 it was arranged for orchestra by Crafton Beck and recorded by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra for their album Down on the Farm. Several other groups, such as US rock band Tonic, have also covered it. Reed also penned and performed the song for the opening credits, entitled \"The Legend\", which tells of some of The Bandit's escapades prior to the events of the film, and the ballad \"The Bandit\", which features in several versions in the movie and on the soundtrack. Reed's hit notwithstanding, Bill Justis is the first name on the credits for the soundtrack as he composed and arranged original music throughout the film. Musicians such as Beegie Adair and George Tidwell played on the soundtrack as part of long careers in music. Legendary five-string banjo player Bobby Thompson is also heard prominently towards the end of \"East Bound and Down.\" The soundtrack album was released in 1977 on vinyl, cassette and 8-track through MCA Records.[16]",

            "Smokey and the Bandit\nThe movie was primarily filmed in Georgia in the cities of McDonough, Jonesboro and Lithonia. The scenes set in Texarkana were filmed in Jonesboro and the surrounding area, and many of the chase scenes were filmed in the surrounding areas on Highway 54 between Fayetteville and Jonesboro for a majority of the driving scenes, Mundy's Mill Road, Main Street in Jonesboro, Georgia State Route 400, I-85 (Pleasant Hill exit), and in McDonough. However, the scene where they drive through the Shell gas station was filmed in Ojai, California on the corner of Ojai and El Paseo. Much of the surrounding scene comes from that immediate vicinity. The scene featuring the racetrack was filmed at Lakewood Speedway at the old Lakewood Fairgrounds on the south side of Atlanta. The roller coaster seen in the movie was the Greyhound. It had not been used for some time and was repainted for the film. It was destroyed in Smokey and the Bandit II and a flashback scene in Part 3.[7]",

At the time, using the 'F' word would immediately require an R rating and this clever self-censorship allowed the film to avoid this rating and reach a much larger audience. However, the scene and the obscured expletive was played for comedy value and written as such, with the passing truck being the gag of the scene more than a way to avoid the censors.",
            "Buford T. Justice\nWhile Justice enjoys the idea of capturing and imprisoning the Bandit for all the things he has done to him in the past, in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 this changes when he finally captures the Bandit (not knowing it was Cledus Snow posing as the Bandit in a plan by the Enoses to make Justice lose the bet). Justice proceeds to have an open \"heart to heart\" conversation with a hallucination of the real Bandit (Reynolds in a cameo) - Justice finally discovers that he had developed an unexpected fondness for the Bandit and despite the fact he was planning to retire after this run, the memory of his disastrous vacation in Miami Beach at the opening of the film and the idea of living a life with no excitement as the voice of his son overplays in his mind, Justice has second thoughts and lets him go so he can resume chasing him. Thus ending the film, and the franchise, in one last hot pursuit.",

Cledus and Justice then start a final pursuit with Buford on two tires, first through a bunch of cattle, then to boats, then finally through a field where the Enoses set off a series of explosives, one of which destroys all of the bodywork, leaving the engine, seats, and police light bar (being held by Junior above his head.) Cledus decides to surrender the fish to let Buford win. Just after cashing in on the $250,000, Buford finds Cledus and begins to apprehend him, but Buford then imagines Cledus to be the \"Real\" Bandit (in a cameo appearance by Burt Reynolds) who sweet talks him to letting him go and starting a new pursuit. Similar to the ending of the 1977 movie, Buford is again chasing the Bandit in the hulk of his police cruiser (the muscular woman has taken Junior's place riding shotgun this time), while Junior chases after him, shouting \"Daddy, don't leave me\" for miles on end, dropping the reward money in the process.",

It should be noted however that many of the film's original sounds were replaced. For instance, the diesel engine start and run up sequence in the opening sequence of the film was completely dubbed over with a totally new sound. A few other examples of \"sound effect replacement\" occur when Bandit takes off after managing to get a reluctant Cledus involved in the bet, and after he comes to a screeching halt on a roadway moments before picking up Carrie. Some of the original sound effects (such as Cledus' dog Fred's barking) and music (such as the final chase to the Southern Classic) were removed and not replaced.

            "You Can't Always Get What You Want\nMuch has been made of the lyrics reflecting the end of the overlong party that was the 1960s, as a snapshot of Swinging London burning out. That's a valid interpretation, but it should also be pointed out that there's also an uplifting and reassuring quality to the melody and performance. This is particularly true of the key lyrical hook, when we are reminded that we can't always get what we want, but we'll get what we need.[4]",
            "You Can't Always Get What You Want\nThe song was performed live with members of Voce Chamber Choir and London Youth Choir[9] for the Stones' 2012 reunion shows in London, November 25 and November 29. The same choir also performed on the track at Glastonbury and two performances at Hyde Park in 2013.",
            "You Can't Always Get What You Want\n\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was the first song recorded for the album. It exists in two versions, a 5:00 single mix[1] and a 7:28 album mix.[2] \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was recorded on 16 and 17 November 1968 at Olympic Sound Studios in London. It features the London Bach Choir opening the song (the choir opening is only on the album version), highlighting throughout, and bringing it to its conclusion. Jimmy Miller, the Stones' producer at the time, plays drums on this song instead of Charlie Watts. Al Kooper plays piano and organ, as well as the French horn intro, while Rocky Dijon plays congas and maracas.[citation needed]",
            "You Can't Always Get What You Want\n\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was something I just played on the acoustic guitar\u00e2\u20ac\u201done of those bedroom songs. It proved to be quite difficult to record because Charlie couldn't play the groove and so Jimmy Miller had to play the drums. I'd also had this idea of having a choir, probably a gospel choir, on the track, but there wasn't one around at that point. Jack Nitzsche, or somebody, said that we could get the London Bach Choir and we said, \"That will be a laugh.\"[3]",
            "You Can't Always Get What You Want\nThe three verses (and the varied theme of the fourth verse) address major topics of the 1960s: love, politics, and drugs. Each verse captures the essence of the initial optimism and eventual disillusion, followed by the resigned pragmatism of the chorus.[citation needed]",
            "You Can't Always Get What You Want\nDonald Trump played the Rolling Stones' recording of the song at campaign appearances during the 2016 Republican primaries and the presidential election, including his nationally televised acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July.[10] After the convention, the band stated publicly that they do not endorse Trump and requested that he cease all use of their songs immediately.[11] Despite the requests to stop, Trump continued using the song at campaign rallies before and after the 2016 election.[12]",

            "Let It Bleed\nAlthough the Stones had begun the recording of \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" in November 1968, before Beggars Banquet had been released, recording for Let It Bleed began in earnest in February 1969 and continued sporadically until early November.[2] Brian Jones performs on only two tracks: playing the autoharp on \"You Got the Silver\", and percussion on \"Midnight Rambler\". His replacement, Mick Taylor, plays guitar on two tracks, \"Country Honk\" and \"Live with Me\", as well as on \"Honky Tonk Women\" which was recorded during the Let It Bleed sessions. Keith Richards, who had already shared vocal duties with Mick Jagger on \"Connection\" and sung separate lead vocals on parts of \"Something Happened to Me Yesterday\" and \"Salt of the Earth\", sang his first solo lead vocal on a Rolling Stones recording with \"You Got the Silver\".[3] The London Bach Choir sang on \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" but publicly disassociated itself from the album, citing what author Stephen Davis terms its \"relentless drug ambience\".[4]",
            "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\nSome controversy surrounds the song's authorship. Andy Razaf's biographer Harry Singer offers circumstantial evidence that suggests Fats Waller might have sold the melody to McHugh in 1926 and that the lyrics were by Andy Razaf.[4] Alternatively, Philip Furia has pointed out that Fields' verse is almost identical to the end of the second verse of Lorenz Hart's and Richard Rodgers' song \"Where's That Rainbow?\" from Peggy-Ann, the 1926 musical comedy with book by Fields' brother Herbert and produced by their father Lew:[5]",

Cottrill and Wnukowski claimed that they authored, recorded and copyrighted a song called \"What You See Is What You Get\" in 1999 to one of Spears' representatives for consideration on a future album, though it was rejected.[99] The case was later dismissed after it was ruled that they lacked sufficient evidence and that there \"weren't enough similarities between the two songs to prove copyright infringement.\"[100]",

            "Can't Buy Me Love\nWhen pressed by American journalists in 1966 to reveal the song's \"true\" meaning, McCartney stated that, \"I think you can put any interpretation you want on anything, but when someone suggests that 'Can't Buy Me Love' is about a prostitute, I draw the line.\" He went on to say: \"The idea behind it was that all these material possessions are all very well, but they won't buy me what I really want.\"[7] However, he was to comment later: \"It should have been 'Can Buy Me Love'\" when reflecting on the perks that money and fame had brought him.[8]",
            "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\nTony Bennett and Lady Gaga released a collaborative jazz album, titled Cheek to Cheek, in 2014.[47] The songs were handpicked by Bennett and Gaga; they selected tracks from the Great American Songbook including \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\", \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\", \"Sophisticated Lady\", \"Lush Life\", and the title track, \"Cheek to Cheek\".[48] The version of \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\" on Cheek to Cheek has Gaga and Bennett alternating verses alongside piano, a brass section and drums.[49] She also altered the lyrics to sing \"Gee, I'd like to say you're looking swell, Tony\", who later rejoins with the line \"Diamond bracelets won't work, doesn't sell, Gaga\".[50][51]",
            "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too\nThe lyrics to the album's lead single, \"You Get What You Give\", drew much attention\u00e2\u20ac\u201dparticularly its bridge, which contained insults directed at Beck, Hanson, Courtney Love, and Marilyn Manson.[23][24] Alexander stated in a 1998 Billboard interview that the song's lyrics are \"mostly about remembering to fly high and be completely off your head in a world where we can't control all the elements. You have to maintain balance because you only get what you give.\"[25] Spin compared the song to Sister Sledge's \"Lost in the Music\",[18] while Gerber noted that the it is virtually expletive-free.[16]",
            "You Can Get It If You Really Want\nThe song has been covered by a great number of artists including by Italian pop singer Sabrina (Sabrina Salerno) in her 1991 album Over the Pop and by Stiff Little Fingers on their 1999 album Hope Street where the song is retitled \"You Can Get It (If Yu Really Want It)\".",
            "(Who Says) You Can't Have It All\nThe music video was directed by Piers Plowden and premiered in early 1994.",
            "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\nLegend has it that the idea behind the song came during a stroll Fields and McHugh were taking one evening down Fifth Avenue; they saw a young couple window-shopping at Tiffany's. McHugh and Fields understood that the couple did not have the resources to buy jewelry from Tiffany's, but nevertheless they drew closer to them. It was then they heard the man say, \"Gee, honey I'd like to get you a sparkler like that, but right now, i can't give you nothin' but love!\" Hearing this, McHugh and Fields rushed to a nearby Steinway Tunnel, and within an hour they came up with \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\".[3]",
            "What a Girl Wants (Christina Aguilera song)\nAfter what was described as an \"incredible\" response to her debut single, the interest in Aguilera began to grow, at which point her record label decided it was time to release a second single.[3] The label and Aguilera disputed over which track should be released, with Aguilera recalling: \"You know, some people do want me to stay in the pop scene, [but] I want to grow from there. I always want to continue growing and getting to that level of, 'Oh, she's a real singer, a real ballad-singer, she can do it'.\"[3] However the announcement then came that \"What a Girl Wants\" would be released as the follow-up single, with Aguilera saying \"The next single will be 'What a Girl Wants', but a totally cool remix of it\".[3] The single was not chosen by Aguilera, but instead her record label RCA and label executive Ron Fair. Aguilera herself had little control over the entire project, and a marketing strategy foresaw that Aguilera would have better success as a \"teen idol\" so in an effort to maintain her persona, music was chosen and recorded under the basis that she would become the next pop phenomenon.[4]",
            "All I Want for Christmas Is You\nWhile the song was praised, it drew criticism for being too similar to the original. Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the new version \"just seems to add a few brassy backup singers to the exact same arrangement.\"[23] Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone agreed, writing that it was \"hard to figure out what's 'extra festive'\" about the new version.[53] Dan Hancox, editor of The National, also felt the new version was unnecessary.[24] In 2011, Justin Bieber also recorded a version of the song as a duet with Carey on his holiday album, Under the Mistletoe.[54]",
            "Can't Get You Out of My Head\nThrough the lyrics of the song, its singer expresses an obsession with an anonymous figure. Dorian Lynskey from The Guardian termed the song a \"mystery\" as Minogue never reveals the identity of her object of infatuation.[15] The critic suggested that the person Minogue is referring to is either \"a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know she exists.\"[15] Writing for the same newspaper, Everett True identified a \"darker element\" in the simple lyrics and felt this sentiment was echoed in Minogue's restrained vocals.[17] Further, True emphasised that while Minogue's 1987 single \"I Should Be So Lucky\" had presented an optimistic romantic future, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" focuses on an \"unhealthy\" and potentially destructive obsession.[17] He also noted that in the former song, Minogue played \"the wide-eyed ing\u00c3\u00a9nue with alacrity,\" but in the latter song she is aware of the harmful nature of her infatuation, calling it a \"desire that is wholly dependent on her own self-control.\"[17]",
            "What You Don't Do\nThe song is a rhythm and blues[4] tune with Jazz and doo-wop[5][6] that grows slowly, and pinpoints the voice of the singer.  The arrangement of the song takes a backseat, while the production has a \"canned sound for the verses\", before starting the choruses.[7]  Horns, gospel-choir style supporting vocals, piano and brass complete the composition.[7][8] \nThe song features truthfulness and wit proclaiming her confidence in her relationship, turning the negative phrase \"What You Don't Do\" into a positive slogan talking about games that the vocalist is not \"forced to endure\".[7]",
            "Sectionals\nThe episode features cover versions of \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" by Barbra Streisand, \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" by The Rolling Stones, \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" by Kelly Clarkson, \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" from Dreamgirls, \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey and \"Proud Mary\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival.[9] Studio recordings of \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\", \"Don't Rain on My Parade\", \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" were released as singles in December 2009, available for download.[10] They are also included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 2.[11] \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" charted at number 85 in Canada and 94 in the US,[12] while \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" charted at number 59 in Canada and 53 in the US.[13] \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" charted at number 51 in Canada and 71 in the US,[14] and \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" charted at number 66 in Australia,[15] 40 in Canada and 51 in the US.[16] Jenna Ushkowitz named \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" one of her favorite songs on the album, deeming the original \"a classic\" and the Glee cover \"emotional\" as one of the final songs of the original run of episodes.[17] The performance of \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" showcased choreography from numerous performances from earlier episodes.[18]",
            "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\nBeing used to later working hours, coupled with his traumatic experience during his overnight flight, the recording session was bad.[3] Take after take was ruined for one reason or another and the band was not relaxed. Presley, usually a very quick study with a song, couldn't get the lyrics right. After 17 takes during three hours,[3] Sholes decided Presley and the band weren't able to record properly and sent them home.",
            "(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\nThe song also invokes another movie from the era, Saturday Night Fever, and the 1960s Animals hit \"We Got to Get Out of This Place.\"[2]  The lyrics describe an average person dreaming of being Superman in order to get through social issues.[6] The lyrics combine \"fantasy\" and \"mundanity,\" two of Davies' favorite themes.[7]  Author Thomas Kitts notes the irony in the lyrics sung by a weakling wishing he were Superman which, as with other songs Davies wrote, leads to the singer feeling resigned.[8]  Author Nick Hasted makes a similar point, that despite dreaming of being Superman, the singer remains Clark Kent and can't get over his fear of the bad news he keeps hearing.[2] According to Allmusic critic Richard Gilliam, its lyrics are among \"Ray Davies' most sharp-edged.\"[6]",
            "If I Can't Have You\nThe song later appeared on the Bee Gees' compilation Their Greatest Hits: The Record. The remixed version was released and remastered in the compilation Bee Gees Greatest in 2007 and marked the return of the Bee Gees to the US Hot Dance Tracks charts after 28 years. According to Maurice, this track was the first song they did while they were recording the other songs for the film. The recording was started at Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville as a basic track only and completed later at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles.[1]",
            "I Just Can't Wait to Be King\nThe song is about the naive desire to do whatever you want once you assume a form of power, or reach the age of majority. However, often when you achieve your goals, you don't acquire freedom in the way your teenage mind imagined it. With great power comes great responsibility.[2] The song is \"An ode to youthful arrogance, invincibility and above all, impatience\".[3]",
            "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\nLennon said of the song, \"That's me in my Dylan period again. I am like a chameleon, influenced by whatever is going on. If Elvis can do it, I can do it. If the Everly Brothers can do it, me and Paul can. Same with Dylan.\" The song is an early example of John self-reflecting in his writing, which had begun with songs such as \"I'm a Loser\" in the summer of 1964. Lennon wrote the song at home during what he called his \"Dylan period,\" wanting another song for the film Help!.[1] The song \"is just basically John doing Dylan,\" Paul McCartney confirmed.[2] The song is similar to a folkish strophic form and uses a Dylanesque acoustic guitar figure in compound time, chiefly acoustic accompaniment, no backing voices and light percussion from brushed snare, tambourine and maraca. A flute, however, replaces the harmonica that Dylan typically used.[3]",
            "You Get What You Give (song)\nIn a Time interview, U2 lead guitarist The Edge is quoted saying \"You Get What You Give\" is the song he is \"most jealous of. I really would love to have written that.\"[8] Billboard gave a mixed review, saying that it was a \"chugging, Wham!-style pop song with slightly cheesy lyrics\" but that the ending lyrics were \"interesting\".[9]",
            "Give You What You Like\nAllan Raible of ABC News also praised the song, writing, \"As the tempos slow down, things get less juvenile and slightly more interesting. 'Give You What You Like' begins with the words, 'Please wrap your drunken arms around me.' (At last, darker material!) This is a rather sleazy song, but it is way more interesting than the shallow stabs at teen pop. At least there is some sort of grit. It's not just a middle finger (referencing the album's opening track, \"Rock n Roll\").\"[10]",
            "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\nJimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields had written the score for a revue at Les Ambassadeurs Club on 57th Street, New York, which featured the vocalist Adelaide Hall. However, the producer Lew Leslie believed that they still missed a 'smash' tune. The team pondered for a while before finally playing Leslie \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\". This was the song Leslie had been looking for and he immediately included it in the revue.[2] Blackbird Revue opened on 4 January 1928 with Adelaide Hall singing \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\" solo. Later on, Fields and McHugh wrote a second half for the revue and Leslie expanded the production. With extra songs and extra performers added (including the vocalist Aida Ward), Leslie renamed the revue Blackbirds of 1928 and took the full production for a tryout in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it appeared at Nixon's Apollo Theatre. On 9 May 1928, Blackbirds of 1928 opened at the Liberty Theatre, Broadway.",
            "The Rolling Stones\nTheir last album of the sixties, Let It Bleed (UK No. 1; US 3)[74] featured \"Gimme Shelter\" with guest lead female vocals from Merry Clayton (sister of Sam Clayton, of the American rock band Little Feat).[137] Other tracks include \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" (with accompaniment by the London Bach Choir, who initially asked for their name to be removed from the album's credits after being apparently 'horrified' by the content of some of its other material, but later withdrew this request), \"Midnight Rambler\" as well as a cover of Robert Johnson's \"Love in Vain\". Jones and Taylor are both featured on the album.[138]",
            "(Who Says) You Can't Have It All\n\"(Who Says)\" You Can't Have It All\" debuted at number 43 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of January 29, 1994.",
            "Off the Wall\nWith the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine described him as a \"blindingly gifted vocalist\".[20] At the time, Rolling Stone compared his vocals to the \"breathless, dreamy stutter\" of Stevie Wonder. Their analysis was also that \"Jackson's feathery-timbered tenor is extraordinary beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly\".[22] Writer, journalist and biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli expressed the opinion that Jackson sings with \"sexy falsetto\" vocals in \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\".[17]",
            "Where You Lead\n\"Where You Lead\" is one of two Carole King/ Toni Stern collaborations featured on Tapestry, the other being the #1 single \"It's Too Late\". King had written the music and the majority of the lyric for \"Where You Lead\" when she solicited the assistance of Stern, saying: \"I can't write the bridge to this: if you can figure out the bridge you can get [co-writing] credit for the song.\" Disliking the arguably servile stance of the song as written by King so far, Stern swiftly conceived lyrics for its bridge which she felt expressed a more empowered narrative voice. The lyrics Stern submitted to King included the lines: \"...if you want to live in f***king New York City/ Honey you know I will\": King herself deleted \"f***king\", then sought Tapestry producer Lou Adler's approval of the \"New York City\" reference; Adler's approval was forthcoming and the lyrics for \"Where You Lead\" were thus complete.[1]",
            "Sparks (band)\n\"This Town Ain't Big Enough For Both of Us\" was written in A, and by God it'll be sung in A. I just feel that if you're coming up with most of the music, then you have an idea where it's going to go. And no singer is gonna get in my way.",
            "I Want to Hold Your Hand\nBob Dylan was impressed by the Beatles' innovation, saying, \"They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid.\"[31] For a time Dylan thought the Beatles were singing \"I get high\" instead of \"I can't hide\". He was surprised when he met them and found out that none of them had actually smoked marijuana.[32] The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson said the song \"wasn't even that great a record, but they [female Beatles fans] just screamed at it. ... It got us off our asses in the studio. We started cutting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we said 'look, don't worry about the Beatles, we'll cut our own stuff.\"[33]",
            "Whataya Want from Me\nThe pop rock song was written by Pink, Max Martin, and Shellback and was recorded by Pink for her fifth studio album, Funhouse, but did not make it to the final cut.[2][3] Lambert's vocal performance of the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.",
            "I Want It That Way\nMany critics over the years have questioned the song's lyrical meaning, mainly the line, \"I want it that way.\" Ben Westhoff of LA Weekly dissected the song, writing that its lyrical content \"makes zero sense\". For Westhoff, \"Mainly, the meaning of 'that' is at issue.\" While analyzing the lyrics, Westhoff perceived that, \"None of the sentiments in the chorus seem to go with any of the other ones. Even worse, no further explanation is given for what 'that' is.\" The critic assumed that in the song \"someone simply doesn't like it when his lover expresses preferences, never wanting to hear when his girlfriend says she wants things in particular ways\".[10]",
            "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\nIn the liner notes to the original release, Nat Hentoff calls the song \"a statement that maybe you can say to make yourself feel better\u00c2\u00a0... as if you were talking to yourself.\" It was written around the time that Suze Rotolo indefinitely prolonged her stay in Italy. The melody is based on the public domain traditional song \"Who's Gonna Buy Your Chickens When I'm Gone\"[1][2] and was taught to Dylan by folksinger Paul Clayton, who had used it in his song \"Who's Gonna Buy You Ribbons When I'm Gone?\"",
            "All I Want for Christmas Is You\nThen for the next week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What do you think about this bit?' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the sessions began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.[6][9]",
            "Won't Get Fooled Again\nThe Who's first attempt to record the song was at the Record Plant on W 44 Street, New York City, on 16 March 1971. Manager Kit Lambert had recommended the studio to the group, which led to his producer credit, though the de facto work was done by Felix Pappalardi. This take featured Pappalardi's Mountain band mate, Leslie West, on lead guitar.[10]",
            "Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\n\"I remember Mimi Kennedy [a cast member of Jim's then-current musical Rhinegold] telling me, she said, you know, when I was probably complaining why no one liked my stuff and couldn't get a deal, she says, \"Well Steiny, your stuff is so complicated. Can't you write something simple?\" And while she was saying that the oldies station was on the radio and it was playing that old Elvis song, 'I Want You, I Need,' whatever it was. 'I Want You, I Need You, I Love You', you know. I just started singing my own song but it was 'I Want You, I Need You, I Love You.' She said, \"Why don't you write something simple like that, 'I want you, I need you, I love you'?\" I said, \"Well I'll try.\" I don't try to make them complicated. I remember going home and I tried so hard but the best I could do was: I want you, I need you but there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you, don't be sad, 'cause two out of three ain't bad. So it was still a twist but it was my closest to a simple song, and one Elvis could have done.\"",
            "I Want You (She's So Heavy)\nLennon wrote the song about his love for Yoko Ono.[4] The song was rehearsed several times during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions; the basic track and Lennon's guide vocal (which is used in the master) were recorded at Trident Studios on 22 February 1969, shortly after shooting for the Let It Be film ended. Lennon played the lead guitar, as George Harrison stated:",
            "Oliver James (actor)\nShortly after appearing in The Afternoon Play, James joined a boy band produced by Simon Fuller. He quit the band as soon as he was cast in What A Girl Wants. For What A Girl Wants, he learned to play the guitar and sang the songs \"Long Time Coming\" and \"Greatest Story Ever Told\" which appear on the film's soundtrack. He played the acoustic guitar and sang the last song in Raise Your Voice.",
            "You Can't Always Get What You Want\nThe song is also very popular at Rolling Stones shows in part because of its sing-along chorus, and is played at almost every show, where it is customary for Jagger to change the lyrics from \"my favourite flavour, cherry red\" to the question \"What's your favourite flavour?\" to which the audience replies \"Cherry red!\" Live recordings appear on the albums Love You Live, Flashpoint, Live Licks, and Sweet Summer Sun: Hyde Park Live, as well as on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, filmed in 1968. Stones concert films that contain the song include: Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones, From the Vault \u2013 L.A Forum - Live in 1975, Let's Spend the Night Together, Stones at the Max, Bridges to Babylon Tour '97\u201398, Four Flicks, The Biggest Bang, and 'Sweet Summer Sun: Hyde Park Live.",
            "We Can't Stop\nCyrus has stated that \"We Can't Stop\" represents \"where I'm at in my life now\".[13] Lyrically, the track describes a house party, as mentioned in the opening lines \"It's our party, we can do what we want / It's our party, we can say what we want / It's our party, we can love who we want / We can kiss who we want / We can live how we want\".[14] It also makes several references to recreational drug use, including \"dancing with molly\", using a slang term for ecstasy, and \"trying to get a line [of cocaine] in the bathroom\".[15] After initial confusion whether the former lyric was \"dancing with molly\" or \"dancing with Miley\", Cyrus clarified that she was referring to ecstasy, commenting that \"if you\u2019re aged ten it\u2019s 'Miley', if you know what I'm talking about then you know. I just wanted it to be played on the radio and they\u2019ve already had to edit it so much.\"[16]",
            "Can I Get A...\nThe chorus of the original song starts with \"Can I Get A 'Fuck You'?\", but it was censored to \"Can I Get A 'What What'?\" and \".. whoop whoop\" for radio airplay. The song deals with the question of whether Jay-Z's girlfriend would stick with him if he wasn't wealthy.[1]",
            "I Can Dream About You\nWhile recording a mimed TV performance of the song, Hartman explained why one music video featured actors: \"The producers and directors of Streets of Fire wanted the best of everything, so they hired the best singers, the best dancers and best actors to play the parts in the film. So the singers in \"I Can Dream About You\" who are the Sorels are actually actors, and I wrote and sang this song.\"[23]",
            "I Can't Live Without You\nSpeculation surrounding the nomination includes Walser's membership to the Recording Academy. Walser stated his position as a voter \"was only helpful to the extent that I had access to the other voters, and they could see what I was doing on a regular basis\".[3] Billboard compared the incident to Linda Chorney, who gained a Grammy Award nomination the previous year through a similar tactic.[4]",
            "What a Girl Wants (Christina Aguilera song)\nSpanish version \"Una Mujer\" received positive reviews. Orlando Sentinel editor Parry Gettelman wrote that it holds up to her \"out of my way\" vocals.[14]",
            "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\nThe song was originally written by Chess Records' in-house writers and producers, Carl Smith and Raynard Miner, and initially recorded by The Dells for the label but not released. Another writer, Gary Jackson made some changes to the song and pitched it to Davis at Brunswick. When the singer recorded his vocal track, Davis recalls, Wilson originally sang the song \"like a soul ballad. I said that's totally wrong. You have to jump and go with the percussion... If he didn't want to sing it that way, I would put my voice on the record and sell millions.\" After hearing Davis's advice, Wilson cut the lead vocal for \"Higher and Higher\" in a single take.[3]"

            "Experimental psychology\nIn the middle of the 20th century, behaviorism became a dominant paradigm within psychology, especially in the United States. This led to some neglect of mental phenomena within experimental psychology. In Europe this was less the case, as European psychology was influenced by psychologists such as Sir Frederic Bartlett, Kenneth Craik, W.E. Hick and Donald Broadbent, who focused on topics such as thinking, memory and attention. This laid the foundations for the subsequent development of cognitive psychology.",
            "Psychology\nThe Association for Behavior Analysis International was founded in 1974 and by 2003 had members from 42 countries. The field has been especially influential in Latin America, where it has a regional organization known as ALAMOC: La Asociaci\u00f3n Latinoamericana de An\u00e1lisis y Modificaci\u00f3n del Comportamiento. Behaviorism also gained a strong foothold in Japan, where it gave rise to the Japanese Society of Animal Psychology (1933), the Japanese Association of Special Education (1963), the Japanese Society of Biofeedback Research (1973), the Japanese Association for Behavior Therapy (1976), the Japanese Association for Behavior Analysis (1979), and the Japanese Association for Behavioral Science Research (1994).[88] Today the field of behaviorism is also commonly referred to as behavior modification or behavior analysis.[88]",
            "Comparative psychology\nNear the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. Douglas Alexander Spalding was called the \"first experimental biologist\",[3] and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. Jacques Loeb emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, Sir John Lubbock is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and Conwy Lloyd Morgan is thought to be \"the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word\".[3]",
            "Behaviorism\nIn the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the cognitive revolution.[56][57] This shift was due to methodological behaviorism being highly criticized for not examining mental processes, and this led to the development of the cognitive therapy movement. In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:",

Watson\nWith his \"behaviorism\", Watson put the emphasis on external behavior of people and their reactions on given situations, rather than the internal, mental state of those people. In his opinion, the analysis of behaviors and reactions was the only objective method to get insight in the human actions. This outlook, combined with the complementary ideas of determinism, evolutionary continuism, and empiricism has contributed to what is now called radical behaviorism. It was this new outlook that Watson claimed would lead psychology into a new era. He claimed that before Wundt there was no psychology, and that after Wundt there was only confusion and anarchy. It was Watson's new behaviorism that would pave the way for further advancements in psychology.",

This approach is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes. Rather than breaking down thoughts and behavior into smaller elements, as in structuralism, the Gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important, and differs from the sum of its parts. Other 19th-century contributors to the field include the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, a pioneer in the experimental study of memory, who developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting at the University of Berlin,[32] and the Russian-Soviet physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed \"classical conditioning\" and applied to human beings.[33]",

Many psychologists used these results to develop theories of human learning, but modern educators generally see behaviorism as one aspect of a holistic synthesis. Teaching in behaviorism has been linked to training, emphasizing the animal learning experiments. Since behaviorism consists of the view of teaching people how to do something with rewards and punishments, it is related to training people.[51]",

Its founders include such figures as Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B.F. Skinner. Pavlov's experimental study of the digestive system in dogs led to extensive experiments through which he established the basic principles of classical conditioning. Watson popularized the behaviorist approach to human behavior; his experiments with Little Albert are particularly well known. Skinner distinguished operant conditioning from classical conditioning and established the experimental analysis of behavior as a major component in the subsequent development of experimental psychology.",

Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views,\" in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science.

            "Behaviorism\nThe field of applied behavior analysis is considered by many to have derived from radical behaviorism. Actually the field derives from both radical behaviorism and the human based psychological behaviorism. Applied behavior analysis has been used in various settings including the treatment of disorders such as autism and substance abuse, as well as child raising, personality development, and abnormal behavior generally [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. In addition, psychological behaviorism has indicated how cognitive schools of psychological thought, while not behavioral, can be joined with a human oriented behaviorism [12]. The field of cognitive behavior therapy, which has widely demonstrated utility in treating certain pathologies including simple phobias, PTSD, and mood disorders, has shown the productivity of that combination.",
            "History of psychology\nJohann Friedrich Herbart (1776\u20131841) took issue with what he viewed as Kant's conclusion and attempted to develop a mathematical basis for a scientific psychology. Although he was unable to empirically realize the terms of his psychological theory, his efforts did lead scientists such as Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795\u201318 78) and Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801\u20131887) to attempt to measure the mathematical relationships between the physical magnitudes of external stimuli and the psychological intensities of the resulting sensations.

            "Behaviorism\nAlthough operant conditioning plays the largest role in discussions of behavioral mechanisms, classical conditioning (or Pavlovian conditioning or respondent conditioning) is also an important behavior-analytic process that need not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov's experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical conditioning procedure. In simple conditioning, the dog was presented with a stimulus such as a light or a sound, and then food was placed in the dog's mouth. After a few repetitions of this sequence, the light or sound by itself caused the dog to salivate.[31] Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed.[citation needed] The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.",
            "Ren\u00e9 Descartes\nAbove all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was divine, thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on emotions and how cognitive evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind. In the 20th century Alan Turing advanced computer science based on mathematical biology as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced physiological theories more than 200 years after his death. The Nobel Prize winning physiologist Ivan Pavlov was a great admirer of Descartes.[82]"

Sam's body and mind may become jumbled with those into whom he has leaped.

It was said to be the future of NASA. Unfortunately, Mr. Goodfarier's rocket lands in Mr. Mertle's back yard (which is now the home of the \"Great Fear\").  Hayley, along with everyone else, frantically attempts many ideas of getting it back, including hiring the boy called \"The Retriever\" (Griffin Reilly Evans), but every time he fails, and decides to retire and go home. Then, just like Benny Rodriguez from the first movie, David decided to go over the wall himself to retrieve the rocket. (Here it is revealed that the little boy who was bitten by \"The Great Fear\" in the story was David himself.) He retrieves it and escapes the Great Fear's yard. The Sandlot kids soon discover (just like The Beast) that The Great Fear got loose. David then hops on his bike and rides out of the sandlot. The Great Fear then chases after David. David then goes through a construction site, and then David gets off his bike and runs back to the sandlot. David hops over the junk wall back to Mr. Mertle's yard and falls through the tunnel that Mac used to try to get the rocket back. The dog knocks over the wall and saves David from suffocating. When David defeats the dog, it's revealed that the dog's real name is Goliath; after that, the kids can be seen running to the sandlot because Goliath got away, and realize that he only wanted to get out to see his girlfriend dog, Tiny (who was also behind a fence). As all the kids are leaving, Hayley and David share a kiss, and Mr. Mertle, tired of kids thinking he's grouchy, decides not to build a new fence.",

They were picked up from him in Wichita and were transported to Baton Rouge, both in driving condition. The 1970 (made to 1969) car then had the engine removed, got the General Lee treatment then weight added to balance the car for the main Freeway jump. One other car was used before this car. The first one landed hard on its nose, broke, and careened right into the guardrail. Given its problematic landing it was not used for that scene. Mr. Barton's car, number 127, was then used for that scene. It was launched from a catapult system, much like that used on aircraft carriers. It flew the farthest of all the jumps in the film and truly did survive. This is the car that made that jump in the film. After the filming the cars were returned to Everett. Everett then put a motor back in the car and even in its jumped condition had driven it in a couple of parades.

So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the original Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called Gulliver on Mars, written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.[29]"

The live musical was executive produced by Marc Platt and Adam Siegel, directed by Scott Ellis and Alex Rudzinski, and starred Matthew Broderick, Andy Walken, Maya Rudolph, Chris Diamantopoulos, and Jane Krakowski.",
            "Christmas Eve and Other Stories\nThe concept of the album revolves around a young man who wanders into a bar on Christmas Eve, where he encounters a mysterious old man who tells him a tale about the magical effect of Christmas Day on the human race. The album takes familiar classical pieces and adds to them new songs and arrangements from both classic and progressive rock influences for which the group is known. The album also contains a mix of vocal and instrumental songs. The primary musicians on the album are all members of the progressive metal band Savatage (Paul O'Neill, the producer of the album, is Savatage's longtime producer). Jon Oliva, one of the principal songwriters on the album, is also a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and original vocalist in Savatage (Oliva is also the voice of Mephistopheles on Beethoven's Last Night).",

It contains the instrumental \"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24\" which originally appeared on Savatage's rock opera, Dead Winter Dead, a story about the Bosnian War. Their 1998 release The Christmas Attic, the sequel to Christmas Eve and Other Stories followed a similar format. This album produced the hit \"Christmas Canon,\" a take on Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D major with lyrics and new melodies added. The Christmas Attic was first performed live in 2014.",

            "Fairytale of New York\nAlthough there is agreement among the band that \"Fairytale of New York\" was first written in 1985, the origins of the song are disputed. MacGowan insisted that it arose as a result of a wager made by the Pogues' producer at the time, Elvis Costello, that the band would not be able to write a Christmas hit single, while the Pogues' manager Frank Murray has stated that it was originally his idea that the band should try and write a Christmas song as he thought it would be \"interesting\".[6][7] It was banjo player Finer who came up with the melody and the original concept for the song, which involved a sailor in New York looking out over the ocean and reminiscing about being back home in Ireland.[7] Finer's wife Marcia did not like the original story, and suggested new lyrics regarding a conversation between a couple at Christmas. Finer told NME, \"I had written two songs complete with tunes, one had a good tune and crap lyrics, the other had the idea for 'Fairytale' but the tune was poxy, I gave them both to Shane and he gave it a Broadway melody, and there it was\".[8]",

It was broadcast from the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California, primarily using outdoor sets. Ellis noted that emphasis on the \"feeling of family\" was an important aspect of the production, as \"it's not just razzle-dazzle stuff and big musical numbers. Our challenge is to never lose sight of the family aspect. And I think \u2014 I hope \u2014 we've succeeded in that.\" Songwriting duo Pasek & Paul, who wrote the songs for A Christmas Story: The Musical, wrote three new songs for the production, including \"In the Market for a Miracle\" for Mrs. Schwartz, \"Ralphie's Nightmare\" for the Parker family, and the opening theme \"Count on Christmas\".[9]",

Carey's goal was to provide an album that would have a \"Christmas feel\", providing a mixture of soulful tracks, as well as fun and joyous holiday treats.[1] The song \"Jesus, Oh What a Wonderful Child\", was described as an original track that \"really took flight\". The song was recorded in a church, with many live back-up singers and children playing tambourines and other melodious instruments.[5] The goal was to produce a \"real church flavored song\", in which Afanasieff played the keyboards and allowed Carey's voice to \"cut loose\".[5] According to Chris Nickson, Carey's love of gospel music came through on the track, writing, \"[she] led the band without pushing herself forward, letting the song develop and work out, trading lines with the chorus until, after the crescendo, the musicians moved into a fast double time to the end.\"[5]",

His wife had come down to drive him home in her Austin Mini to save money because it was cheaper to drive than travel by train, as Rea was just out of record contract and the record company was not willing to pay for the rail ticket. The inspiration for the song came as they were getting stuck in heavy traffic, while the snow was falling. He started looking at the other drivers, who \"all looked so miserable. Jokingly, I started singing: \"We're driving home for Christmas ...\" Then, whenever the street lights shone inside the car, I started writing down lyrics\". Rea said \"Driving Home for Christmas\" is a \"car version of a carol\",[7][8] and that he wrote it for Van Morrison, but did not manage to get it to him.[9]",

Universal also said that Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard would reprise their roles from the previous film.[3] At the time of the film's announcement, Trevorrow said the series \"isn't always going to be limited to theme parks\" and confirmed that the film would not involve \"a bunch of dinosaurs chasing people on an island. That'll get old real fast.\"[30] Trevorrow also spoke of the film's possible open-source storyline: \"It's almost like InGen is Mac, but what if PC gets their hands on it? What if there are 15 different entities around the world who can make a dinosaur?\"[30]",

I just cast a bunch of character actors, as all Jurassic Park movies have. And somehow we ended up with a movie star.\"[15] Pratt described his character as a combination of Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm: \"He's got a little bit of the Goldblum cynicism but also the Sam Neill excitement at the wonder of the biology of it all, so it's a combination.\"[168] Although Pratt received top billing in the cast, Trevorrow stated that Howard's character, Claire, is the lead character.[140][169]",

While the rest of the group tours the park by Land Cruiser, she stays with Dr. Harding, the park vet, to help diagnose a sick Stegosaurus (Triceratops in the film). After the Tyrannosaurus attack, she helps Dr. Harding take care of Ian Malcolm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s injuries.

Along the way, Dutch explorers were charged to claim any uncharted areas for the United Provinces, which led to several significant expeditions and, over time, Dutch explorers founded the province of New Netherland. By 1610, the VOC had already commissioned English explorer Henry Hudson who, in an attempt to find the so-called northwest passage to the Indies, discovered and claimed for the VOC parts of the present-day United States and Canada. Hudson entered the Upper New York Bay by sailboat, heading up the Hudson River, which now bears his name.",

In 1664, English troops under the command of the Duke of York (later James II of England) attacked the New Netherland colony. Being greatly outnumbered, director general Peter Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam, with Fort Orange following soon. New Amsterdam was renamed New York, Fort Orange was renamed Fort Albany. Dutch city names can still be found in New York's neighbourhoods. Harlem is Haarlem, Staten Island is Staten Eiland and Brooklyn refers to Breukelen.",

In 1674, Dutch navy captain Jurriaen Aernoutsz also briefly captured two forts in the French colony of Acadia, which he claimed as Dutch territory the new colony of New Holland. However, Aernoutsz's appointed administrator, John Rhoades, quickly lost control of the territory after Aernoutsz himself left for Cura\u00e7ao to seek out new settlers, and with effective control of Acadia remaining in the hands of France, Dutch sovereignty existed only on paper until the Netherlands surrendered their claim in the Treaties of Nijmegen.",

Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape, Dutch West India Company policy required its colonists to purchase the land that they settled. The first to do so was Michiel Pauw who established a patronship called Pavonia in 1630 along the North River which eventually became the Bergen. Peter Minuit's purchase of lands along the Delaware River established the colony of New Sweden. The entire region became a territory of England on June 24, 1664, after an English fleet under the command of Colonel Richard Nicolls sailed into what is today New York Harbor and took control of Fort Amsterdam, annexing the entire province.",

Under the Treaty of Breda (1667), New Netherland was ceded to England in exchange for the English settlements in Suriname, which had been conquered by Dutch forces earlier that year. Though the Dutch would again take New Netherland in 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, it was returned to England the following year, thereby ending the Dutch Empire in continental North America, but leaving behind a large Dutch community under English rule that persisted with its language, church and customs until the mid-18th century.[50] In South America, the Dutch seized Cayenne from the French in 1658 and drove off a French attempt to retake it a year later. However, it was returned to France in 1664, since the colony proved to be unprofitable. It was recaptured by the Dutch in 1676, but was returned again a year later, this time permanently.

This effectively ended the Dutch rule of the colony and, for that matter, ended their claims to any land in colonial North America. Delaware was thenceforth claimed by New York under a Deputy of the Duke of York from 1664 to 1682, but not actually held in the Duke's possession nor his colonists, a situation taken advantage of by the proprietors of Maryland.[2]",

In actual practice, however, the territory remained under French control. By the time of the Treaty of Nijmegen, however, the Dutch claim to Acadia was simply abandoned.

The English Commonwealth was short lived, and the monarchy soon restored. The Dutch Republic continued in name until 1795, but by the mid-18th century the stadtholder had become a de facto monarch. Calvinists were also some of the earliest settlers of the British and Dutch colonies of North America.",

This includes secular broad-mindedness and mercantile pragmatism in the city as well as rural traditionalism in the countryside (typified by the story of Rip Van Winkle). Notable Americans of Dutch descent include Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Frelinghuysens.[29]",

The city still maintains a distinctive Dutch flavour. Flushing, a neighborhood within the borough of Queens, New York, is named after the city Flushing (Vlissingen in Dutch) in Zeeland. This dates from the period of the colony of New Netherland, when New York was still known as New Amsterdam. The Dutch colonies of Nieuw Walcheren and Nieuw Vlissingen, both on the Antillian island of Tobago, were both named after parts of Zeeland. The Canadian town of Zealand, New Brunswick, was named for the Zeeland birthplace of Dutchman Philip Crouse who settled in the area in 1789.[6] Zeeland, North Dakota is another town named for this province and whose earliest settlers were of Dutch heritage.",

New Netherland was slowly settled during its first decades, partially as a result of policy mismanagement by the Dutch West India Company (WIC), and conflicts with Native Americans. During the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the Atlantic World, tolerating a highly diverse ethnic mix. The surrender of Fort Amsterdam to the British control in 1664 was formalized in 1667, contributing to the Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War.

The Dutch had been sending ships annually to the Hudson River to trade fur since Henry Hudson's voyage of 1609.[36] To protect its precarious position at Albany from the nearby English and French, the Company founded the fortified town of New Amsterdam in 1625, at the mouth of the Hudson, encouraging settlement of the surrounding areas of Long Island and New Jersey.[37] The fur trade ultimately proved impossible for the Company to monopolize due to the massive illegal private trade in furs, and the settlement of New Netherland was unprofitable.[38] In 1655, the nearby colony of New Sweden on the Delaware River was forcibly absorbed into New Netherland after ships and soldiers were sent to capture it by the Dutch governor, Pieter Stuyvesant.[39]",

The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the \"Apologie\" of William the Silent, condemning the Spanish Inquisition, which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church. The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies.

Commencement of the fur trade provoked hostility from the French colony in Canada and among the natives, all of whom vied to control the trade. In 1618, a flood ruined the fort on Castle Island, but it was rebuilt in 1624 as Fort Orange.[21] Both forts were named in honor of the Dutch royal House of Orange-Nassau.[22] Fort Orange and the surrounding area were incorporated as the village of Beverwijck (English: Beaver District) in 1652.[23][24] In these early decades of trade, the Dutch, Mohican and Mohawk developed relations that reflected differences among their three cultures.[25]",

He returned in the same year, and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland, taking over from Willem Verhulst. He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4, 1626.[6] Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 guilders.

Samuel Blommaert secretly tried to secure his interests with the founding of the colony of New Sweden on behalf of Sweden on the Delaware in the south. The main focus of the WIC now went to Brazil.",
            "Province of New Jersey\nThe Province of New Jersey was originally settled in the 1610s as part of the colony of New Netherland. The surrender of Fort Amsterdam in September 1664 gave control over the entire Mid-Atlantic region to the English as part the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The English justified the seizure by claiming that John Cabot (c. 1450 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c c. 1508), an Italian under the sponsorship of the English King Henry VII, had been the first to discover the place, though it was probably to assert control over the profitable North Atlantic trade. Director-General of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant, (unable to rouse a military defense) relinquished control of the colony and was able in the articles of transfer to secure guarantees for property rights, laws of inheritance, and freedom of religion. After the surrender Richard Nicolls took the position as deputy-governor of New Amsterdam and the rest of New Netherland, including those settlements on the west side of the North River (Hudson River) known as Bergen, and those along the Delaware River that had been New Sweden.",
            "Yankee\nThe Online Etymology Dictionary gives its origin as around 1683, when it was applied insultingly to Dutch Americans (especially freebooters) by the English. Linguist Jan de Vries notes that there was mention of a pirate named Dutch Yanky in the 17th century.[13] The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves (1760) contains the passage, \"Haul forward thy chair again, take thy berth, and proceed with thy story in a direct course, without yawing like a Dutch yanky.\"[14] It was at some point reappropriated by Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam who started using it against the English colonists of neighboring Connecticut.[12]",
            "List of colonial governors of New York\nNew Netherland was conceived as a private business venture to exploit the North American fur trade.[4] By the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the North Atlantic. The leader of the Dutch colony was known by the title Director or Director-General. On August 27, 1664, four English frigates commanded by Richard Nicolls sailed into New Amsterdam's harbor and demanded the surrender of New Netherland.[5][6] This event sparked the Second Anglo-Dutch War, which led to the transfer of the territory to England per the Treaty of Breda.[7][8]",
            "Conquistador\nIn the 17th century, taking advantage of this period of Portuguese weakness, the Dutch occupied many Portuguese territories in Brazil. John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1637 by the Dutch West India Company. He landed at Recife, the port of Pernambuco, in January 1637. In a series of expeditions, he gradually expanded from Sergipe on the south to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds de Maranh\u00e3o in the north. He likewise conquered the Portuguese possessions of Elmina Castle, Saint Thomas, and Luanda and Angola. The Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long lasting and troublesome to Portugal. The Seventeen Provinces captured a large portion of the Brazilian coast including the provinces of Bahia, Pernambuco, Para\u00edba, Rio Grande do Norte, Cear\u00e1, and Sergipe, while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The large area of Bahia and its city, the strategically important Salvador, was recovered quickly by an Iberian military expedition in 1625.",
            "New York (state)\nDuring the 17th century, Dutch trading posts established for the trade of pelts from the Lenape, Iroquois, and other tribes were founded in the colony of New Netherland. The first of these trading posts were Fort Nassau (1614, near present-day Albany); Fort Orange (1624, on the Hudson River just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau), developing into settlement Beverwijck (1647), and into what became Albany; Fort Amsterdam (1625, to develop into the town New Amsterdam which is present-day New York City); and Esopus, (1653, now Kingston). The success of the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony. The English captured the colony during the Second Anglo-Dutch War and governed it as the Province of New York. The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch in 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1674) and renamed New Orange. It was returned to the English under the terms of the Treaty of Westminster a year later.[51]",
            "Dutch Empire\nIn 1795, the French revolutionary army invaded the Dutch Republic and turned the nation into a satellite of France, named the Batavian Republic. Britain, which was at war with France, soon moved to occupy Dutch colonies in Asia, South Africa and the Caribbean."

        "question": "who coined the phrase let them eat cake",
        "docs": [
            "Let them eat cake\nWhile the phrase is commonly attributed to Queen Marie Antoinette,[1] there is no record of her having said it. It appears in book six of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Confessions, his autobiography (whose first six books were written in 1765, when Marie Antoinette was nine years of age, and published in 1782). The context of Rousseau's account was his desire to have some bread to accompany some wine he had stolen; however, feeling he was too elegantly dressed to go into an ordinary bakery, he recollected the words of a \"great princess\":[2]",
            "Let them eat cake\n\"Let them eat cake\" is the traditional translation of the French phrase \"Qu'ils mangent de la brioche\", supposedly spoken by \"a great princess\" upon learning that the peasants had no bread. Since brioche was a luxury bread enriched with butter and eggs, the quote would reflect the princess's disregard for the peasants, or her poor understanding of their situation.",
            "Let them eat cake\nHowever, there is no evidence that Queen Marie-Antoinette ever uttered this phrase. It was first attributed to her by Alphonse Karr in Les Gu\u00c3\u00aapes of March, 1843.[6] Other objections to the legend of Marie-Antoinette and the cake/brioche comment centre on arguments concerning the queen's personality, internal evidence from members of the French royal family and the date of the saying's origin. For example, the Queen's English-language biographer, Antonia Fraser, wrote in 2002:",
            "Let them eat cake\nAnother hypothesis is that after the revolution, the phrase was attributed to various princesses of the French royal family, and that the legend stuck on Marie-Antoinette because she was, in effect, the last \"great princess\" of Versailles. The myth had, for example, been previously attributed to two of Louis XV's daughters: Madame Sophie and Madame Victoire.",
            "Let them eat cake\nIn his novel Ange Pitou (1853), Alexandre Dumas attributes the quote to one of Marie-Antoinette's favourites, the Duchess of Polignac.",
            "Let them eat cake\nThe quotation, as attributed to Marie Antoinette, was claimed to have been uttered during one of the famines that occurred in France during the reign of her husband, Louis XVI. Upon being alerted that the people were suffering due to widespread bread shortages, the Queen is said to have replied, \"Then let them eat brioche.\"[4] Although this anecdote was never cited by opponents of the monarchy at the time of the French Revolution, it did acquire great symbolic importance in subsequent histories when pro-revolutionary historians sought to demonstrate the obliviousness and selfishness of the French upper classes at that time. As one biographer of the Queen notes, it was a particularly useful phrase to cite because \"the staple food of the French peasantry and the working class was bread, absorbing 50 percent of their income, as opposed to 5 percent on fuel; the whole topic of bread was therefore the result of obsessional national interest.\"[5]",
            "Let them eat cake\nThere is a further problem with the dates surrounding the attribution, in that Marie-Antoinette was not only too young but also outside France when it was written. Although only published in 1782, Rousseau's Confessions were finished in 1769. Marie Antoinette, aged 14, didn't arrive at Versailles from Austria until 1770. She was unknown to him at the time of writing his work so she could not have been the \"great princess\" mentioned by Rousseau.[10]",
            "Let them eat cake\nA second point is that there were no actual famines during the reign of King Louis XVI and only two incidents of serious bread shortages, which occurred, first, in April\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMay 1775, a few weeks before the king's coronation (11 June 1775), and again in 1788, the year before the French Revolution. The 1775 shortages led to a series of riots, known as the Flour War, la guerre des farines, a name given at the time of their occurrence, that took place in the northern, eastern and western parts of France. Letters from Marie-Antoinette to her family in Austria at this time reveal an attitude totally different to the Let them eat cake mentality.",
            "Let them eat cake\n[Let them eat cake] was said 100 years before her by Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, the wife of Louis XIV. It was a callous and ignorant statement and she, Marie Antoinette, was neither.[7]",
            "You can't have your cake and eat it\nAlternatively, the two verbs can be understood to represent a sequence of actions, so one can indeed \"have\" one's cake and then \"eat\" it. Consequently, the literal meaning of the reversed idiom doesn't match the metaphorical meaning. The phrase can also have specialized meaning in academic contexts; Classicist Katharina Volk of Columbia University has used the phrase to describe the development of poetic imagery in Latin didactic poetry, naming the principle behind the imagery's adoption and application the \"have-one's-cake-and-eat-it-too principle\".[18]",
            "English grammar\nThe basic form of the verb (be, write, play) is used as the infinitive, although there is also a \"to-infinitive\" (to be, to write, to play) used in many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: (to) have written, (to) be writing, (to) have been writing. The second-person imperative is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with let (let us go, or let's go; let them eat cake).",
            "You can't have your cake and eat it\nAn early recording of the phrase is in a letter on 14 March 1538 from Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, to Thomas Cromwell, as \"a man can not have his cake and eat his cake\".[8]",
            "Let them eat cake\nEnfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d\u2019une grande princesse \u00e0 qui l\u2019on disait que les paysans n\u2019avaient pas de pain, et qui r\u00e9pondit\u00a0: Qu\u2019ils mangent de la brioche.[2]",
            "Let them eat cake\nThe Book of Jin, a 7th-century chronicle of the Chinese Jin Dynasty, reports that when Emperor Hui (259\u2013307) was told that his people were starving because there was no rice, he said, \"Why don't they eat (ground) meat?\" (\u4f55\u4e0d\u98df\u8089\u7cdc), as part of showing how incompetent he was.[14][15]",
            "Let them eat cake\nThe attribution also has little credibility. Fraser cites as justification for the alternative attribution to the wife of Louis XIV the memoirs of Louis XVIII, who was only fourteen when Rousseau's Confessions were written and whose own memoirs were published much later. He does not mention Marie-Antoinette in his account, but states that the saying was an old legend, and that within the family it was always believed that the saying belonged to the Spanish princess who married Louis XIV in the 1660s. Thus, Louis XVIII is as likely as others to have had his recollection affected by the quick spreading and distorting of Rousseau's original remark.",
            "You can't have your cake and eat it\nThe order was reversed again in a posthumous adaptation of \"Polite Conversation\" in 1749, \"Tittle Tattle; or, Taste A-la-Mode\", as \"And she cannot have her Cake and eat her Cake.\"[12][13][14] From 1812 (R. C. Knopf's \"Document Transcriptions of War of 1812\" (1959) VI. 204) is a modern-sounding recording of \"We cannot have our cake and eat it too.\"[15]",
            "Let them eat cake\nFraser points out in her biography that Marie-Antoinette was a generous patroness of charity and moved by the plight of the poor when it was brought to her attention, thus making the statement out-of-character for her.[8] This makes it unlikely that Marie-Antoinette ever said this.",
            "French fashion\nThe phrase \"Let them eat cake\" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a \"journalistic clich\u00e9\".[14] It may have been a rumor started by angry French peasants as a form of libel. This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part (finished in 1767, published in 1782) of Rousseau's putative autobiographical work, Les Confessions: \"Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d'une grande princesse \u00e0 qui l'on disait que les paysans n'avaient pas de pain, et qui r\u00e9pondit: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche\" (\"Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat brioche'\"). Apart from the fact that Rousseau ascribes these words to an unknown princess, vaguely referred to as a \"great princess\", some think that he invented it altogether as Confessions was largely inaccurate.[15]",
            "You can't have your cake and eat it\nThe phrase occurs with the clauses reversed in John Heywood's \"A dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of All the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue\" from 1546, as \"wolde you bothe eate your cake, and have your cake?\".[9] In John Davies' \"Scourge of Folly\" of 1611, the same order is used, as \"A man cannot eat his cake and haue it stil.\"[10] In Jonathan Swift's 1738 farce \"Polite Conversation\", the character Lady Answerall says \"she cannot eat her cake and have her cake.\"[11]",
            "You can't have your cake and eat it\nPaul Brians, Professor of English at Washington State University, points out that perhaps a more logical or easier to understand version of this saying is, \"You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat your cake and have it too.\" Professor Brians writes that a common source of confusion about this idiom stems from the verb to have which in this case indicates that once eaten, keeping possession of the cake is no longer possible, seeing that it is in your stomach (and no longer exists as a cake).[17]",
            "Marie Antoinette\nThe phrase \"Let them eat cake\" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence that she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a journalistic clich\u00e9.[218] This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's autobiographical work Les Confessions, finished in 1767 and published in 1782: \"Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d'une grande princesse \u00e0 qui l'on disait que les paysans n'avaient pas de pain, et qui r\u00e9pondit: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche\" (\"Finally I recalled the stop-gap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat brioche'\"). Rousseau ascribes these words to a \"great princess\", but the purported writing date precedes Marie Antoinette's arrival in France. Some think that he invented it altogether.[219]",
            "You can't have your cake and eat it\nIn English, \"have\" can mean \"eat\", as in \"Let's have breakfast\" or \"I'm having a sandwich\". So the saying \"You can't have your cake and eat it too\" may mean that you can't eat the cake and then eat it again; or less metaphorically, that what you want is unreasonable. This interpretation makes sense in both the \"have-eat\" and \"eat-have\" iterations of the idiom, and might explain why the earliest known iteration is \"have-eat\".[original research?]",
            "Let Me In (film)\nIn comparing Let Me In with Let the Right One In, horror website Bloody Disgusting wrote, \"Ultimately, if the Swedish version is near perfection, Matt Reeves's version achieves complete supremacy. Masterpiece is an overused word, but it's hard to think of another so powerful. Let Me In is the new standard for vampire movies.\"[54] Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote \"Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years.\"[55] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film \"is more than a respectful remake; 'Let Me In' is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right.\"[56]",
            "Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love\nOne commentator saw the phrase Let's do \"it\" as a euphemistic reference to a proposition for sexual intercourse.[1] According to this argument, Let's do it was a pioneer pop song to declare openly \"sex is fun\". According to it, several suggestive lines include a couplet from verse 4: \"Moths in your rugs do it, What's the use of moth-balls?\" and \"Folks in Siam do it, Think of Siamese twins\" (verse 1) and \"Why ask if shad do it?  Waiter, bring me shad roe\" (verse 3) and \"Sweet guinea-pigs do it, Buy a couple and wait\" (verse 5).[6] There is also a report that Porter's original version included the even more risqu\u00c3\u00a9 line, \"Roosters with a doodle and a cock do it\"[citation needed]. If true, this was probably replaced by one of the lines in the verse 2 couplet \"Penguins in flocks, on the rocks, do it, Even little cuckoos, in their clocks, do it.\"",
            "You can't have your cake and eat it\nThe order of the clauses in the saying has been the subject of some debate, and was even used in forensic linguistics (contributing to the identification and arrest of the so-called Unabomber).[7]",

The American version is called Let Me In because the publishers believed that the original title was too long. They first suggested the title be changed to Let Her In, but Lindqvist suggested Let Me In instead, given that 'Her' was inaccurate.[7] It is the vampire who must be careful to let the right person in on her secret.

            "You can't have your cake and eat it\nYou can't have your cake and eat it (too) is a popular English idiomatic proverb or figure of speech.[1] The proverb literally means \"you cannot simultaneously retain your cake and eat it\". Once the cake is eaten, it is gone. It can be used to say that one cannot or should not have or want more than one deserves or is reasonable, or that one cannot or should not try to have two incompatible things. The proverb's meaning is similar to the phrases \"you can't have it both ways\" and \"you can't have the best of both worlds.\"",
            "Cake\nLater, during the post-war boom, other American companies (notably General Mills) developed this idea further, marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the 1950s, marketers discovered that the cake in a box rendered the cake-making function of housewives relatively dispiriting. This was a time when women, retired from the war-time labor force, and in a critical ideological period in American history, were confined to the domestic sphere and oriented towards the freshly blossoming consumerism in the US.[9] In order to compensate for this situation, the marketing psychologist Ernest Dichter ushered in the solution to the cake mix problem: frosting.[10] Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend their creative energy on cake decorating inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes.",

Baked goods are normally served at all kinds of party and special attention is given to their quality at formal events.

            "History of evolutionary thought\nIn 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor. Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection: it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry, biogeography, geology, morphology, and embryology. Debate over Darwin's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution, but the specific mechanism he proposed, natural selection, was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s. Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution. Alternatives to natural selection suggested during \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" (c. 1880 to 1920) included inheritance of acquired characteristics (neo-Lamarckism), an innate drive for change (orthogenesis), and sudden large mutations (saltationism). Mendelian genetics, a series of 19th-century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900, was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s, and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics. During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields, resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe modern synthesis.",
            "Victorian era\nThe model town of Saltaire was founded, along with others, as a planned environment with good sanitation and many civic, educational and recreational facilities, although it lacked a pub, which was regarded as a focus of dissent. During the Victorian era, science grew into the discipline it is today. In addition to the increasing professionalism of university science, many Victorian gentlemen devoted their time to the study of natural history. This study of natural history was most powerfully advanced by Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution first published in his book On the Origin of Species in 1859.",
            "History of biology\nOver the 18th and 19th centuries, biological sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began to connect the animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlaying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.",
            "Natural selection\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.",
            "Introduction to evolution\nThe modern understanding of evolution began with the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. In addition, Gregor Mendel's work with plants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of genetics.[27] Fossil discoveries in paleontology, advances in population genetics and a global network of scientific research have provided further details into the mechanisms of evolution. Scientists now have a good understanding of the origin of new species (speciation) and have observed the speciation process in the laboratory and in the wild. Evolution is the principal scientific theory that biologists use to understand life and is used in many disciplines, including medicine, psychology, conservation biology, anthropology, forensics, agriculture and other social-cultural applications.",
            "Darwinism\nEnglish biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term Darwinism in April 1860.[4] It was used to describe evolutionary concepts in general, including earlier concepts published by English philosopher Herbert Spencer. Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called Lamarckism. The strict neo-Darwinism of German evolutionary biologist August Weismann gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During the approximate period of the 1880s to about 1920, sometimes called \"the eclipse of Darwinism,\" scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms which eventually proved untenable. The development of the modern synthesis in the early 20th century, incorporating natural selection with population genetics and Mendelian genetics, revived Darwinism in an updated form.[5]",
            "On the Origin of Species\nThe book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T.\u00c2\u00a0H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences.",
            "Charles Darwin\nDarwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species.[9][10] By the 1870s, the scientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.[11][12] Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.[13][14]",
            "On the Origin of Species\nScientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \"law of development\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design.[209] Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.[210]",
            "Reactions to On the Origin of Species\nThe most famous confrontation took place at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, when the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce argued against Darwin's explanation. In the ensuing debate Joseph Hooker argued strongly in favor of Darwinian evolution. Thomas Huxley's support of evolution was so intense that the media and public nicknamed him \"Darwin's bulldog\". Huxley became the fiercest defender of the evolutionary theory on the Victorian stage. Both sides came away feeling victorious, but Huxley went on to depict the debate as pivotal in a struggle between religion and science and used Darwinism to campaign against the authority of the clergy in education, as well as daringly advocating the \"Ape Origin of Man\".",
            "History of Western civilization\nThe 1859 publication of On the Origin of Species, by the English naturalist Charles Darwin, provided an alternative hypothesis for the development, diversification, and design of human life to the traditional poetic scriptural explanation known as Creationism. According to Darwin, only the organisms most able to adapt to their environment survived while others became extinct. Adaptations resulted in changes in certain populations of organisms which could eventually cause the creation of new species. Modern genetics started with Gregor Johann Mendel, a German-Czech Augustinian monk who studied the nature of inheritance in plants. In his 1865 paper \"Versuche \u00fcber Pflanzenhybriden\" (\"Experiments on Plant Hybridization\"), Mendel traced the inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically.[36] Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister made discoveries about bacteria and its effects on humans. Geologists at the time made discoveries indicating the world was far older than most believed it to be. Early batteries were invented and a telegraph system was also invented, allowing global communication. In 1869 Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published his Periodic table. The success of Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made: The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered. The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as cobalt and nickel, to better classify them into chemical families. At the end of the 19th century, a number of discoveries were made in physics which paved the way for the development of modern physics \u2013 including Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie's work on radioactivity.",
            "History of biology\nThe most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans.[38] The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.[39]",
            "History of biology\nThe 1859 publication of Darwin's theory in On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life is often considered the central event in the history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous Vestiges of Creation had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and common descent by the end of the 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.[40]",
            "Human evolution\nThe first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. However, many of Darwin's early supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by natural selection, though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans when he published The Descent of Man in 1871.[47]",
            "On the Origin of Species\nOn the Origin of Species (or more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life),[3] published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.[4] Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.[5]",
            "Zoology\nDarwin gave a new direction to morphology and physiology, by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a genealogical basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of Mendel's work led to the rapid development of genetics, and by the 1930s the combination of population genetics and natural selection in the modern synthesis created evolutionary biology.[9]",
            "Zoology\nThese developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so.[8]",
            "Charles Darwin\nBy the time of his death, Darwin had convinced most scientists that evolution as descent with modification was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. In June 1909, though few at that time agreed with his view that \"natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification\", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in Cambridge to commemorate his centenary and the fiftieth anniversary of On the Origin of Species.[166] Around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called \"the eclipse of Darwinism\", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable. Ronald Fisher, an English statistician, finally united Mendelian genetics with natural selection, in the period between 1918 and his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection.[167] He gave the theory a mathematical footing and brought broad scientific consensus that natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution, thus founding the basis for population genetics and the modern evolutionary synthesis, with J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, which set the frame of reference for modern debates and refinements of the theory.[12]",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nThe biogeographical patterns Charles Darwin observed in places such as the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle caused him to doubt the fixity of species, and in 1837 Darwin started the first of a series of secret notebooks on transmutation. Darwin's observations led him to view transmutation as a process of divergence and branching, rather than the ladder-like progression envisioned by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and others. In 1838 he read the new 6th edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population, written in the late 18th century by Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus' idea of population growth leading to a struggle for survival combined with Darwin's knowledge on how breeders selected traits, led to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin did not publish his ideas on evolution for 20 years. However, he did share them with certain other naturalists and friends, starting with Joseph Dalton Hooker, with whom he discussed his unpublished 1844 essay on natural selection. During this period he used the time he could spare from his other scientific work to slowly refine his ideas and, aware of the intense controversy around transmutation, amass evidence to support them. In September 1854 he began full-time work on writing his book on natural selection.[73][84][85]",
            "Darwinism\nAnother important evolutionary theorist of the same period was the Russian geographer and prominent anarchist Peter Kropotkin who, in his book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and sociological arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce competition as the core of evolution, which provided a rationalization for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:",
            "Charles Darwin\nPuzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.[17] Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.[18] He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories.[19] Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature.[11] In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.[20][21]",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nThe concept of evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles within a few years of the publication of Origin, but the acceptance of natural selection as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century were theistic evolution, neo-Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and saltationism. Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included structuralism, Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary functionalism, and vitalism.",
            "Evolution\nThe crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a \"struggle for existence\" in which favorable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism.[57][58][59][60] Darwin developed his theory of \"natural selection\" from 1838 onwards and was writing up his \"big book\" on the subject when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a version of virtually the same theory in 1858. Their separate papers were presented together at an 1858 meeting of the Linnean Society of London.[61] At the end of 1859, Darwin's publication of his \"abstract\" as On the Origin of Species explained natural selection in detail and in a way that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of Darwin's concepts of evolution at the expense of alternative theories. Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide strong evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe.[62]",
            "On the Origin of Species\nCharles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction.[12] Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.[13] His pal\u00e6ontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.[14]",
            "Modern history\nAt the end of the 19th century, Social Darwinism was promoted and included the various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas was a \"natural\" framework for social evolution in human societies. In this view, society's advancement is dependent on the \"survival of the fittest\", the term was in fact coined by Herbert Spencer and referred to in \"The Gospel of Wealth\" written by Andrew Carnegie.",
            "Microevolution\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. The term was introduced by Darwin in his groundbreaking 1859 book On the Origin of Species,[30] in which natural selection was described by analogy to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favored for reproduction. The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, nothing was known of modern genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical and molecular genetics is termed the modern evolutionary synthesis. Natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.",
            "History of biology\nThe scientific study of heredity grew rapidly in the wake of Darwin's Origin of Species with the work of Francis Galton and the biometricians. The origin of genetics is usually traced to the 1866 work of the monk Gregor Mendel, who would later be credited with the laws of inheritance. However, his work was not recognized as significant until 35 years afterward. In the meantime, a variety of theories of inheritance (based on pangenesis, orthogenesis, or other mechanisms) were debated and investigated vigorously.[43] Embryology and ecology also became central biological fields, especially as linked to evolution and popularized in the work of Ernst Haeckel. Most of the 19th century work on heredity, however, was not in the realm of natural history, but that of experimental physiology.",
            "History of botany\nUntil the 1860s it was believed that species had remained unchanged through time: each biological form was the result of an independent act of creation and therefore absolutely distinct and immutable. But the hard reality of geological formations and strange fossils needed scientific explanation. Charles Darwin's Origin of Species (1859) replaced the assumption of constancy with the theory of descent with modification. Phylogeny became a new principle as \"natural\" classifications became classifications reflecting, not just similarities, but evolutionary relationships. Wilhelm Hofmeister established that there was a similar pattern of organization in all plants expressed through the alternation of generations and extensive homology of structures.[100]",
            "On the Origin of Species\nThe leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan.[217] Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \"ordained becoming\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \"creation by birth\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design.[218][219] Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate.[220][221] In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \"Great Hippocampus Question\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \"great hippopotamus test\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains.[222] Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871).[223]",
            "Natural selection\nErnst Mayr recognised the key importance of reproductive isolation for speciation in his Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942).[44] W. D. Hamilton conceived of kin selection in 1964.[45][46] This synthesis cemented natural selection as the foundation of evolutionary theory, where it remains today. A second synthesis was brought about at the end of the 20th century by advances in molecular genetics, creating the field of evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\"), which seeks to explain the evolution of form in terms of the genetic regulatory programs which control the development of the embryo at molecular level. Natural selection is here understood to act on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.[47][48][49][50]",
            "Lamarckism\nWhen Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in On the Origin of Species (1859), he continued to give credence to what he called \"use and disuse inheritance,\" but rejected other aspects of Lamarck's theories. Later, Mendelian genetics supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits, eventually leading to the development of the modern synthesis, and the general abandonment of the Lamarckian theory of evolution in biology. Despite this abandonment, interest in Lamarckism has continued.",
            "History of biology\nThe history of biology traces the study of the living world from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of biology as a single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from traditions of medicine and natural history reaching back to ayurveda, ancient Egyptian medicine and the works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by Muslim physicians and scholars such as Avicenna. During the European Renaissance and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were Vesalius and Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as Linnaeus and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as the development and behavior of organisms. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek revealed by means of microscopy the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory. The growing importance of natural theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the argument from design).",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nIn the 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution, George Gaylord Simpson showed that the fossil record was consistent with the irregular non-directional pattern predicted by the developing evolutionary synthesis, and that the linear trends that earlier paleontologists had claimed supported orthogenesis and neo-Lamarckism did not hold up to closer examination. In 1950, G. Ledyard Stebbins published Variation and Evolution in Plants, which helped to integrate botany into the synthesis. The emerging cross-disciplinary consensus on the workings of evolution would be known as the modern synthesis. It received its name from the 1942 book Evolution: The Modern Synthesis by Julian Huxley.[105][106]",
            "Modern synthesis (20th century)\nIn 1977, recombinant DNA technology enabled biologists to start to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of evolutionary developmental biology from 1978, when Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes, showed that many so-called toolkit genes act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed that some of the regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the Pax6 gene is involved in forming the eyes of mice and of fruit flies. Such deep homology provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.[87]",
            "Sociocultural evolution\nAuguste Comte, known as \"the father of sociology\", formulated the law of three stages: human development progresses from the theological stage, in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings; through a metaphysical stage in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them; until the final positive stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship.[7] This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and through increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of the world.[8] Comte saw the science-valuing society as the highest, most developed type of human organization.[7]",
            "Natural selection\nIn 1881, the embryologist Wilhelm Roux published Der Kampf der Theile im Organismus (The Struggle of Parts in the Organism) in which he suggested that the development of an organism results from a Darwinian competition between the parts of the embryo, occurring at all levels, from molecules to organs.[115] In recent years, a modern version of this theory has been proposed by Jean-Jacques Kupiec. According to this cellular Darwinism, random variation at the molecular level generates diversity in cell types whereas cell interactions impose a characteristic order on the developing embryo.[116]",
            "Herbert Spencer\nSpencer first articulated his evolutionary perspective in his essay, 'Progress: Its Law and Cause', published in Chapman's Westminster Review in 1857, and which later formed the basis of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy (1862). In it he expounded a theory of evolution which combined insights from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'The Theory of Life' \u2013 itself derivative from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturphilosophie \u2013 with a generalisation of von Baer's law of embryological development. Spencer posited that all structures in the universe develop from a simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity to a complex, differentiated, heterogeneity, while being accompanied by a process of greater integration of the differentiated parts. This evolutionary process could be found at work, Spencer believed, throughout the cosmos. It was a universal law, that was applying to the stars and the galaxies as much as to biological organisms, and to human social organisation as much as to the human mind. It differed from other scientific laws only by its greater generality, and the laws of the special sciences could be shown to be illustrations of this principle.",
            "Lamarckism\nAlso included were a number of paleontologists like Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt, who felt that the fossil record showed orderly, almost linear, patterns of development that they felt were better explained by Lamarckian mechanisms than by natural selection. Some people, including Cope and the Darwin critic Samuel Butler, felt that inheritance of acquired characteristics would let organisms shape their own evolution, since organisms that acquired new habits would change the use patterns of their organs, which would kick-start Lamarckian evolution. They considered this philosophically superior to Darwin's mechanism of random variation acted on by selective pressures. Lamarckism also appealed to those, like the philosopher Herbert Spencer and the German anatomist Ernst Haeckel, who saw evolution as an inherently progressive process.[24] The German zoologist Theodor Eimer combined Larmarckism with ideas about orthogenesis.[26]",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nDarwin's theory succeeded in profoundly altering scientific opinion regarding the development of life and in producing a small philosophical revolution.[94] However, this theory could not explain several critical components of the evolutionary process. Specifically, Darwin was unable to explain the source of variation in traits within a species, and could not identify a mechanism that could pass traits faithfully from one generation to the next. Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis, while relying in part on the inheritance of acquired characteristics, proved to be useful for statistical models of evolution that were developed by his cousin Francis Galton and the \"biometric\" school of evolutionary thought. However, this idea proved to be of little use to other biologists.[95]",

Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: but it did not explain embryology.[8][16]",

During that time many scientists and philosophers accepted the reality of evolution but doubted whether natural selection was the main evolutionary mechanism.[23]",

Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate development in a wide range of eukaryotes.",
            "Modern synthesis (20th century)\nThe 19th century ideas of natural selection and Mendelian genetics were put together with population genetics, early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed the relationship between the broad-scale changes of macroevolution seen by palaeontologists and the small-scale microevolution of local populations of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with Ernst Mayr in 1959, G. Ledyard Stebbins in 1966 and Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included E. B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch, Ivan Schmalhausen, and George Gaylord Simpson. An early event in the modern synthesis was R. A. Fisher's 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but William Bateson, and separately Udny Yule, were already starting to show how Mendelian genetics could work in evolution in 1902.",
            "History of science\nPerhaps the most prominent, controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of evolution by natural selection put forward by the British naturalist Charles Darwin in his book On the Origin of Species in 1859. Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology.[119] Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of \"man's place in the universe\". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the Moravian[120] monk Gregor Mendel in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of genetics, which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, James D. Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins clarified the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms.[121] In the late 20th century, the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome (the Human Genome Project).",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nUnlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, influenced by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when he began his career as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species.[86]",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nThe word evolution (from the Latin evolutio, meaning \"to unroll like a scroll\") was initially used to refer to embryological development; its first use in relation to development of species came in 1762, when Charles Bonnet used it for his concept of \"pre-formation,\" in which females carried a miniature form of all future generations. The term gradually gained a more general meaning of growth or progressive development.[45]",
            "Introduction to evolution\nThe theory of evolution is widely accepted among the scientific community, serving to link the diverse specialty areas of biology.[35] Evolution provides the field of biology with a solid scientific base. The significance of evolutionary theory is summarised by Theodosius Dobzhansky as \"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\"[93][94] Nevertheless, the theory of evolution is not static. There is much discussion within the scientific community concerning the mechanisms behind the evolutionary process. For example, the rate at which evolution occurs is still under discussion. In addition, there are conflicting opinions as to which is the primary unit of evolutionary change\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe organism or the gene.",
            "Sociocultural evolution\nWhile 19th-century evolutionism explained how culture develops by giving general principles of its evolutionary process, it was dismissed by the Historical Particularists as unscientific in the early 20th century. It was the neo-evolutionary thinkers who brought back evolutionary thought and developed it to be acceptable to contemporary anthropology.",

            "Anthropology\nSimilar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the American Anthropological Association in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory (1869) founded by Rudolph Virchow, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.",
            "Evolution\nIn the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin formulated the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection, published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution by natural selection is a process first demonstrated by the observation that often, more offspring are produced than can possibly survive. This is followed by three observable facts about living organisms: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).[10] Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.",
            "Modern synthesis (20th century)\nCharles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species was successful in convincing most biologists that evolution had occurred, but was less successful in convincing them that natural selection was its primary mechanism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, variations of Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics), orthogenesis (progressive evolution), saltationism (evolution by jumps) and mutationism (evolution driven by mutations) were discussed as alternatives.[4] Alfred Russel Wallace advocated a selectionist version of evolution, and unlike Darwin completely rejected Lamarckism.[5] In 1880, Wallace's view was labelled neo-Darwinism by Samuel Butler.[6][7]",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nOne of the first and most important naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the X Club to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with naturalism and to end the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species.[90] In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of Archaeopteryx in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the evolution of the horse from its small five-toed ancestors.[91] However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both August Weismann and Ernst Haeckel championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain.[92] Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.[93]",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nIn 1871, Darwin published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, which contained his views on human evolution. Darwin argued that the differences between the human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.[98]",
            "Fossil\nEarly naturalists well understood the similarities and differences of living species leading Linnaeus to develop a hierarchical classification system still in use today. Darwin and his contemporaries first linked the hierarchical structure of the tree of life with the then very sparse fossil record. Darwin eloquently described a process of descent with modification, or evolution, whereby organisms either adapt to natural and changing environmental pressures, or they perish.",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nIn the late 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism came to be associated with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. Inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history.[101][102] Critics of neo-Lamarckism, such as the German biologist August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace, pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.[101][102]",
            "Alfred Russel Wallace\nBoth Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation. But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose (\"teleology\") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers:",

Their objections are in contrast to the level of support for the theory by more than 99 percent of those within the scientific community today.[35]",
            "Franz Boas\nWhile on Baffin Island he began to develop his interest in studying non-Western cultures (resulting in his book, The Central Eskimo, published in 1888). In 1885, Boas went to work with physical anthropologist Rudolf Virchow and ethnologist Adolf Bastian at the Royal Ethnological Museum in Berlin. Boas had studied anatomy with Virchow two years earlier while preparing for the Baffin Island expedition. At the time, Virchow was involved in a vociferous debate over evolution with his former student, Ernst Haeckel. Haeckel had abandoned his medical practice to study comparative anatomy after reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, and vigorously promoted Darwin's ideas in Germany. However, like most other natural scientists prior to the rediscovery of Mendelian genetics in 1900 and the development of the modern synthesis, Virchow felt that Darwin's theories were weak because they lacked a theory of cellular mutability. Accordingly, Virchow favored Lamarckian models of evolution. This debate resonated with debates among geographers. Lamarckians believed that environmental forces could precipitate rapid and enduring changes in organisms that had no inherited source; thus, Lamarckians and environmental determinists often found themselves on the same side of debates.",
            "Herbert Spencer\nSpencer's attempt to explain the evolution of complexity was radically different from that to be found in Darwin's Origin of Species which was published two years later. Spencer is often, quite erroneously, believed to have merely appropriated and generalised Darwin's work on natural selection. But although after reading Darwin's work he coined the phrase 'survival of the fittest' as his own term for Darwin's concept,[5] and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society, he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognised was Lamarckian use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations. Spencer believed that this evolutionary mechanism was also necessary to explain 'higher' evolution, especially the social development of humanity. Moreover, in contrast to Darwin, he held that evolution had a direction and an end-point, the attainment of a final state of equilibrium. He tried to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology. He proposed that society was the product of change from lower to higher forms, just as in the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life are said to be evolving into higher forms. Spencer claimed that man's mind had evolved in the same way from the simple automatic responses of lower animals to the process of reasoning in the thinking man. Spencer believed in two kinds of knowledge: knowledge gained by the individual and knowledge gained by the race. Intuition, or knowledge learned unconsciously, was the inherited experience of the race.",
            "Universal Darwinism\nAt the most fundamental level, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution states that organisms evolve and adapt to their environment by an iterative process.  This process can be conceived as an evolutionary algorithm that searches the space of possible forms (the fitness landscape) for the ones that are best adapted. The process has three components:",
            "Science and the Catholic Church\nCatholic scientists contributed to the development of evolutionary theory. Among the foremost Catholic contributors to the development of the modern understanding of evolution was the Jesuit-educated Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) and the Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel (1822-1884).[28] Lamark developed Lamarckism, the first coherent theory of evolution, proposing in Philosophie Zoologique (1809) and other works his theory of the transmutation of species and drawing a genealogical tree to show the genetic connection of organisms.[87] Mendel discovered the basis of genetics following long study of the inherited characteristics of pea plants, although his paper Experiments on Plant Hybridization, published in 1866, was famously overlooked until the start of the next century.[88] The work of Catholic scientists like the Danish Bishop Nicolas Steno helped establish the science of geology, leading to modern scientific measurements of the age of the earth.[35] The church accepts modern geological theories on such matters and the authenticity of the fossil record. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate that the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life. The Church's stance is that the temporal appearance of life has been guided by God.",
            "Paleontology\nThis contributed to a rapid increase in knowledge about the history of life on Earth and to progress in the definition of the geologic time scale, largely based on fossil evidence. In 1822 Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blanville, editor of Journal de Physique, coined the word \"palaeontology\" to refer to the study of ancient living organisms through fossils.[105] As knowledge of life's history continued to improve, it became increasingly obvious that there had been some kind of successive order to the development of life. This encouraged early evolutionary theories on the transmutation of species.[106] After Charles Darwin published Origin of Species in 1859, much of the focus of paleontology shifted to understanding evolutionary paths, including human evolution, and evolutionary theory.[106]",
            "History of evolutionary thought\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, a theory of the transmutation of species (transformisme). Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.[61][62]",
            "Lamarckism\nAmong the most popular alternatives were theories involving the inheritance of characteristics acquired during an organism's lifetime. Scientists who felt that such Lamarckian mechanisms were the key to evolution were called neo-Lamarckians and included the British botanist George Henslow (1835\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1925), who studied the effects of environmental stress on the growth of plants, in the belief that such environmentally-induced variation might explain much of plant evolution, and the American entomologist Alpheus Spring Packard, Jr., who studied blind animals living in caves and wrote a book in 1901 about Lamarck and his work.[24][25]",

In the view of the evolutionary biologist Eugene Koonin in 2009, the modern synthesis will be replaced by a 'post-modern' synthesis that will include revolutionary changes in molecular biology, the study of prokaryotes and the resulting tree of life, and genomics.[3]",

He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.[90]",
            "Modern synthesis (20th century)\nThe theoretical biologist and philosopher of biology Joseph Henry Woodger led the introduction of positivism into biology with his 1929 book Biological Principles. He saw a mature science as being characterised by a framework of hypotheses that could be verified by facts established by experiments. He criticised the traditional natural history style of biology, including the study of evolution, as immature science, since it relied on narrative.[35] Woodger set out to play for biology the role of Robert Boyle's 1661 Sceptical Chymist, intending to convert the subject into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the Vienna Circle of logical positivists like Otto Neurath and Rudolf Carnap, to reduce biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist J. B. S. Haldane to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and by influencing thinkers such as Huxley, helped to bring about the modern synthesis.[35] The positivist climate made natural history unfashionable, and in America, research and university-level teaching on evolution declined almost to nothing by the late 1930s. The Harvard physiologist William John Crozier told his students that evolution was not even a science: \"You can't experiment with two million years!\"[36]"

He could speak English decently, but he could perfectly understand everything that was being said to him. He also started viewing the others on the ship as superiors to him instead of barbaric and scary. He wanted to be like them. Equiano went to London with his Master and was sent to serve for the Guerins. He liked it there and they provided him an education. He got baptized with the help of Miss Guerins. After a while his Master got called back to sea, so Equiano had to leave school to work for his Master. They went to Gibraltar, which allowed him to get cheap fruit and tell the story of losing his sister. A person who lived in the area told him that he saw his sister and took him to her, but it ended up not being his sister. Equiano met Daniel Queen while working for his Master and he quickly became a big part of his life. He taught him a variety of things like religion, education, and how to shave. Equiano viewed him almost like a father and tried to repay him with sugar or Tabaco whenever he could afford it.

The rising was marked by widespread assaults on the British Protestant communities in Ireland, sometimes culminating in massacres. Rumours spread in England and Scotland that the killings had the King's sanction and that this was a foretaste of what was in store for them if the King's Irish troops landed in Britain. As a result, the English Parliament refused to pay for a royal army to put down the rebellion in Ireland and instead raised its own armed forces.

            "History of the Constitution of the United Kingdom\nMost of England believed that Parliament had done enough to curb the power of King Charles I, but the radicals in Parliament (the extremist Puritans) and the radicals around the country (again, extremist Puritans) wanted to reform the Church of England by getting rid of the bishops (and all other things with the semblance of Catholicism) and by establishing the Puritans' method of worship as the standard. This caused a political division in Parliament, so Charles I took advantage of it. He then sent 500 soldiers into the House of Commons to arrest five of the Puritans' ringleaders (John Hampden included). The five ringleaders had been tipped off, so they had left Parliament and Charles I was left with only shame for storming Parliament.",

Arminians in this sense were moderates on, or even opposed to, some key tenets of Calvinism. In the same period the Twelve Years' Truce ended, and the Thirty Years' War broke out, changing the international situation in Western Europe drastically.",

Charles's adherence to the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings, a doctrine foreign to the English mentality he had inherited from his father, fuelled a vicious battle for supremacy between King and Parliament. Therefore, when Charles approached the Parliament to pay for a campaign against the Scots, they refused, declared themselves to be permanently in session and put forward a long list of civil and religious grievances that Charles would have to remedy before they approved any new legislation. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Ireland, Charles I's Lord Deputy there, Thomas Wentworth, had antagonised the native Irish Catholics by repeated initiatives to confiscate their lands and grant them to English colonists. He had also angered them by enforcing new taxes but denying Roman Catholics full rights as subjects. What made this situation explosive was his idea, in 1639, to offer Irish Catholics the reforms they had been looking for in return for them raising and paying for an Irish army to put down the Scottish rebellion. Although the army was to be officered by Protestants, the idea of an Irish Catholic army being used to enforce what was seen by many as tyrannical government horrified both the Scottish and the English Parliament, who in response threatened to invade Ireland.",

Cromwell had come to the conclusion that the current military system was untenable because it relied on local militias defending local areas. Cromwell proposed that Parliament create a new army that would be deployable anywhere in the kingdom and not tied to a particular locality. After the Second Battle of Newbury of 27 October 1644, where parliamentary forces greatly outnumbered royalist forces and yet parliamentary forces were barely able to defeat the royalist forces, Cromwell redoubled his arguments in favor of creating a new army. At this point, most of the leaders in the parliamentary army were Presbyterians who supported the Presbyterians at the Westminster Assembly. Cromwell, however, had also been following the goings-on of the Westminster Assembly and he sided with the Independents. Cromwell thought that the Presbyterians in the army\u00a0\u2013 notably his superior, Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester\u00a0\u2013 opposed his proposal to create a new and more effective army mainly because they wanted to make peace with the king.

Cromwell, however, felt that parliamentary forces should seek total victory over the royalists, and since he distrusted Charles immensely, he felt that Charles should have no role in any post-war government.",

Ultimately, the Catholic James II was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, and his successors, the Protestants William III and Mary II, accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after James II had attempted to disarm many Protestants, and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.[37] The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms.[38] In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.[39]",

            "History of the Constitution of the United Kingdom\nDuring the second part of the Bishops' War, Charles I had run very low on money (since he was also fighting France and Spain), so he was forced to call a Parliament to make new taxes. He and the Parliament could not agree on anything, so after three weeks, Charles I dissolved the Parliament. Then he desperately needed new taxes, so Charles I called a Parliament again and it would only help him if he agreed to some terms, which ultimately made Charles I a constitutional monarch. It was called the Long Parliament (1640\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1660), because it was not officially dissolved by its own vote until 1660.",
            "Cavalier\nAlthough they did not share the same outlook on how to worship God as the English Independents of the New Model Army, God was often central to their lives.[6] This type of Cavalier was personified by Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading, whose prayer at the start of the Battle of Edgehill has become famous \"O Lord, Thou knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not forget me\".[7] At the end of the First Civil War Astley gave his word that he would not take up arms again against Parliament and having given his word he felt duty bound to refuse to help the Royalist cause in the Second Civil War.",
            "English Civil War\nIreland had known continuous war since the rebellion of 1641, with most of the island controlled by the Irish Confederates.[116] Increasingly threatened by the armies of the English Parliament after Charles I's arrest in 1648, the Confederates signed a treaty of alliance with the English Royalists.[117] The joint Royalist and Confederate forces under the Duke of Ormonde attempted to eliminate the Parliamentary army holding Dublin by laying siege to the city, but their opponents routed them at the Battle of Rathmines (2 August 1649).[118] As the former Member of Parliament Admiral Robert Blake blockaded Prince Rupert's fleet in Kinsale, Oliver Cromwell could land at Dublin on 15 August 1649 with an army to quell the Royalist alliance in Ireland.[119]",
            "Indian massacre of 1622\nOpechancanough withdrew his warriors, believing that the English would behave as Native Americans would when defeated: pack up and leave, or learn their lesson and respect the power of the Powhatan.[15]  Following the event, Opechancanough told the Patawomeck, who were not part of the Confederacy and had remained neutral, that he expected \"before the end of two Moones there should not be an Englishman in all their Countries.\"[16] He misunderstood the English colonists and their backers overseas.",
            "Battle of the Boyne\nConversely, for the Williamites, the war was about maintaining Protestant and English rule in Ireland. They feared for their lives and their property if James and his Catholic supporters were to rule Ireland, nor did they trust the promise of tolerance, seeing the Declaration of Indulgence as a ploy to re-establish Catholicism as the sole state religion. In particular, they dreaded a repeat of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, which had been marked by widespread killing. For these reasons, Protestants fought en masse for William of Orange. Many Williamite troops at the Boyne, including their very effective irregular cavalry, were Ulster Protestants, who called themselves \"Enniskilliners\" and were referred to by contemporaries as \"Scots-Irish\". These \"Enniskilliners\" were mostly the descendants of Anglo-Scottish border reivers and large numbers of these reivers had settled around Enniskillen in County Fermanagh, hence the name \"Enniskilliners\".[citation needed]",
            "Charge of the Light Brigade\nCardigan survived the battle. Although stories circulated afterwards that he was not actually present,[11] he led the charge from the front and, never looking back, did not see what was happening to the troops behind him. He reached the Russian guns, took part in the fight, and then returned alone up the valley without bothering to rally or even find out what had happened to the survivors. He afterwards said all he could think about was his rage against Captain Nolan, who he thought had tried to take over the leadership of the charge from him. After riding back up the valley, he considered he had done all that he could and then, with considerable sang-froid, left the field and went on board his yacht in Balaclava harbour, where he ate a champagne dinner.[12] He subsequently described the engagement in a speech delivered at the Mansion House in London that was afterwards quoted in length in the House of Commons:[citation needed]",
            "Slavery in the United States\nDuring the colonial period, the status of slaves was affected by interpretations related to the status of foreigners in England. England had no system of naturalizing immigrants to its island or its colonies. Since persons of African origins were not English subjects by birth, they were among those peoples considered foreigners and generally outside English common law. The colonies struggled with how to classify people born to foreigners and subjects. In 1656 Virginia, Elizabeth Key Grinstead, a mixed-race woman, successfully gained her freedom and that of her son in a challenge to her status by making her case as the baptized Christian daughter of the free Englishman Thomas Key. Her attorney was an English subject, which may have helped her case. (He was also the father of her mixed-race son, and the couple married after Key was freed.)[18]",
            "Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom\nEmily Davies became an editor of a feminist publication, Englishwoman's Journal. She expressed her feminist ideas on paper and was also a major supporter and influential figure during the twentieth century. In addition to suffrage, she supported more rights for women such as access to education. She wrote works and had power with words. She wrote texts such as Thoughts on Some Questions Relating to Women in 1910 and Higher Education for Women in 1866. She was a large supporter in the times where organisations were trying to reach people for a change.[31] With her was a friend named Barbara Bodichon who also published articles and books such as Women and Work (1857), Enfranchisement of Women (1866), and Objections to the Enfranchisement of Women (1866), and American Diary in 1872.[32]",
            "Olaudah Equiano\nEquiano commented on the reduced rights that freed people of colour had in these same places, and they also faced risks of kidnapping and enslavement. Equiano had embraced Christianity at the age of 14 and its importance to him is a recurring theme in his autobiography; he identified as a Protestant of the Church of England. He was baptized while in London."

            "What Child Is This?\n\"What Child Is This?\" is a Christmas carol whose lyrics were written by William Chatterton Dix, in 1865. At the time of composing the carol, Dix worked as an insurance company manager and had been struck by a severe illness. While recovering, he underwent a spiritual renewal that led him to write several hymns, including lyrics to this carol that was subsequently set to the tune of \"Greensleeves\", a traditional English folk song. Although it was written in Great Britain, the carol is more popular in the United States than in its country of origin today.[1]",
            "What Child Is This?\nAt the time he was writing the lyrics to \"What Child Is This?\" in 1865, William Chatterton Dix was working as the manager of an insurance company.[5] He was afflicted by an unexpected and severe illness that resulted in him being bedridden and suffering from severe depression. His near-death experience brought about a spiritual renewal in him while he was recovering. During this time, he read the Bible comprehensively and was inspired to author hymns like \"Alleluia! Sing to Jesus!\" and \"As with Gladness Men of Old\".[1][4] The precise time in 1865 when he wrote the poem \"The Manger Throne\" is disputed. While the St. Petersburg Times details how Dix penned the work after reading the Gospel for Epiphany that year (Matthew 2:1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12) recounting the journey of the Biblical Magi;[6] Singer's Library of Song: Medium Voice contends that it was actually authored during the Christmas of 1865.[4]",
            "What Is Life\n\"What Is Life\" has appeared in the soundtrack for feature films such as Goodfellas (1990), Patch Adams (1998), Big Daddy (1999) and This Is 40 (2012). Harrison's original recording was included on the compilations The Best of George Harrison and Let It Roll, and live versions appear on his album Live in Japan (1992) and in Martin Scorsese's 2011 documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World. In 1972, Olivia Newton-John had a UK hit with her version of the song. Ronnie Aldrich, the Ventures and Shawn Mullins are among the other artists who have covered the track.",
            "What Child Is This?\nAlthough written in 1865, \"What Child Is This?\" was only first published six years later in 1871, when it featured in Christmas Carols Old and New,[6] a \"prestigious\"[7] and \"influential\"[8] collection of carols that was published in the United Kingdom.[7] The hymnal was edited by Henry Ramsden Bramley and John Stainer; even though it is not known with certainty who paired the three stanzas from \"The Manger Throne\" with the music from \"Greensleeves\", the third edition of The Christmas Encyclopedia by William D. Crump and Stories of the Great Christmas Carols both suggest that Stainer \u2013 who was also responsible for \"harmoniz[ing] the musical setting\"[3] \u2013 may have done so.[1][3]",
            "What Are Little Boys Made Of?\nExtracts from the nursery rhyme appear in several popular songs, including \"Nothing Can Change This Love\" by Sam Cooke from 1962 and \"Sugar and Spice\" by The Searchers, from 1963. \"Sugar and spice, and all things nice\" is also a verse in the Stone Roses early single \"Sally Cinnamon\". Van Halen in 1991 released the song \"Poundcake,\" which contains part of the lyrics in the beginning of the music video. Alternative rock band Garbage incorporate the words of the rhyme in their song, \"What Girls Are Made of,\" on the Deluxe edition of their 2012 studio album Not your Kind of People.",
            "What Child Is This?\nThe lyrics of the carol are taken from a poem written by Dix called \"The Manger Throne\".[1][2] The part of the poem that was utilized as the song's lyrics consists of three stanzas in total.[1] The first verse poses a rhetorical question in the first half, with the response coming in the second half. The second verse contains another question that is answered, while the final verse is a universal appeal to everyone urging them \"to accept Christ\".[3] The carol's melody has been described as \"soulful\",[1] \"haunting and beautiful\" in nature.[4]",
            "What Child Is This?\nThe context of the carol centres around the Adoration of the Shepherds, who visited Jesus during his Nativity. The questions posed in the lyrics reflect what the shepherds were possibly pondering to themselves when they encountered him, with the rest of the carol providing a response to their questions.[1]",
            "What Is Love\n\"What Is Love\" was written and produced by German music producer and composer Dee Dee Halligan (Dieter L\u00fcnstedt a.k.a. Tony Hendrik) and Junior Torello (Karin Hartmann-Eisenbl\u00e4tter a.k.a. Karin van Haaren) of Coconut Records in Cologne. They were in wait for the right singer to sing the song. Trinidadian-born singer Nestor Alexander Haddaway was then chosen to sing it. He used to work as a producer, dancer and choreographer before he was signed to Coconut Records.[3] In a 2012 interview Haddaway said about the making of \"What Is Love\":",
            "The Land of Make Believe\nThe lyrics are based on a child's dream where ghostly voices lure the child outside to a world where everything is bright and happy, but the child resists. Characters, Superman and Captain Kidd are referenced in the lyrics. The close of the song features a nursery rhyme narrated by Abby Kimber, who was the 11-year-old daughter of Bill Kimber, an executive of RCA Records. This was an original piece penned by Sinfield. At the time, radio stations were instructed to fade the song before the narration.[3] Sinfield said that the song \"Beneath its tra-la-la's is a virulent anti-Thatcher song\" and went on to say \"it is ten-times more difficult to write a three-minute hit song, with a veneer of integrity, than it is to write anything for King Crimson or ELP\".[4]",
            "What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)\nWhile traveling on his tour bus with the Four Tops on May 15, 1969, Four Tops member Renaldo \"Obie\" Benson witnessed an act of police brutality and violence committed on anti-war protesters who had been protesting at Berkeley's People's Park in what was later termed as \"Bloody Thursday\".[10] A disgusted Benson later told author Ben Edmonds, \"I saw this and started wondering 'what was going on, what is happening here?' One question led to another. Why are they sending kids far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their own kids in the street?\"[10][11] Returning to Detroit, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland wrote and composed a song based on his conversations with Benson of what he had seen in Berkeley. Benson sent the unfinished song to his bandmates but the other Four Tops turned the song down.[10] Benson said, \"My partners told me it was a protest song. I said 'no man it's a love song, about love and understanding. I'm not protesting. I want to know what's going on.'\"[10][11]",
            "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\nJohnson's music experienced a revival in the 1960s thanks in large part to the efforts of blues guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. A highly regarded figure within the burgeoning New York folk scene, Davis gave copies of Johnson's records to young musicians and taught them to play his songs. The Soul Stirrers, Staples Singers, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Peter, Paul & Mary all covered Johnson.[6] In 1969, the English folk-rock band Fairport Convention released the album What We Did on Our Holidays which included a song inspired by \"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\" called \"The Lord Is in this Place...How Dreadful Is this Place\".[10] A compilation album titled Dark Was the Night was released in 2009 by the Red Hot Organization, a charity that raises awareness of HIV and AIDS issues through music. The Kronos Quartet recorded an arrangement of \"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\" that appears on the album.[11] The song \"Excavating Rita\" by Half Man Half Biscuit on their 2011 album 90 Bisodol (Crimond) quotes the song's title.",
            "Why Does the Sun Shine? (The Sun Is a Mass of Incandescent Gas)\nAll of the songs on the EP are cover versions, except for one. The title song is a cover of a song by Hy Zaret from Tom Glazer's 1959 album, Space Songs. The lyrics for the refrain appear verbatim in the 1951 Golden Guide \"Stars\".[3] They Might Be Giants re-arranged the song in an uptempo version for their 1998 live album, Severe Tire Damage, and their 2009 children's album, Here Comes Science, on which they added the self-penned \"Why Does The Sun Really Shine? (The Sun is a Miasma of Incandescent Plasma)\", which corrects several factual inaccuracies in the original song. It was also included on the soundtrack to the children's game show Carmen Sandiego: Out of This World.[4]",
            "What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)\nThis is immediately followed in segue flow by the second track, \"What's Happening Brother\", a song Gaye dedicated to his brother Frankie, in which Gaye wrote to explain the disillusionment of war veterans who returned to civilian life and their disconnect from pop culture.[20] \"Flyin' High (In the Friendly Sky)\", which took its title from a United Airlines tag, \"fly the friendly skies\", dealt with dependence on heroin. The lyric, \"I know, I'm hooked my friend, to the boy, who makes slaves out of men\", references heroin as \"boy\", which was slang for the drug. \"Save the Children\" was an emotional plea to help disadvantaged children, warning, \"who really cares/who's willing to try/to save a world/that is destined to die?\", later crying out, \"save the babies\". A truncated version of \"God Is Love\" follows \"Save the Children\" and makes references to God.",
            "What's Going On (Marvin Gaye song)\nThe song's inspiration came from Renaldo \"Obie\" Benson, a member of the Motown vocal group the Four Tops, after he and the group's tour bus arrived at Berkeley on May 15, 1969.[8] While there, Benson witnessed police brutality and violence in the city's People's Park during a protest held by anti-war activists in what was hailed later as \"Bloody Thursday\".[8] Upset by the situation, Benson said to author Ben Edmonds that as he saw this, he asked, \"'What is happening here?' One question led to another. Why are they sending kids so far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their own children in the streets?\"[8][9]",
            "Is That All There Is?\nThe song was inspired by the 1896 story Disillusionment (Entt\u00e4uschung) by Thomas Mann. \nJerry Leiber's wife Gaby Rodgers (n\u00e9e Gabrielle Rosenberg) was born in Germany, lived in the Netherlands. She escaped ahead of the Nazis, and settled in Hollywood where she had a brief film career in films noir. Gaby introduced Leiber to the works of Thomas Mann.[5] The narrator in Mann's story tells the same stories of when he was a child. A dramatic adaptation of Mann's story was recorded by Erik Bauserfeld and Bernard Mayes; it was broadcast on San Francisco radio station KPFA in 1964.[6]",
            "What Is Life\nFollowing Harrison's death, Japanese band the Collectors contributed a recording of \"What Is Life\" to the Gentle Guitar Dreams tribute album, released in May 2002.[98] Classical guitarist Joseph Breznikar recorded a version of the song for his 2003 tribute album George Harrison Remembered: A Touch of Class.[99] In November 2004, Neal Morse released his recording of \"What Is Life\" on the special-edition version of his album One.[100] Les Fradkin included a cover of \"What Is Life\" on his 2005 tribute CD Something for George.[101]",
            "Aaliyah\nAaliyah attended the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, where she majored in drama and graduated in 1997 with a 4.0 GPA.[13][39][40] Aaliyah began her acting career that same year; she played herself in the police drama television series New York Undercover.[41] During this time, Aaliyah participated in the Children's Benefit Concert, a charity concert that took place at the Beacon Theatre in New York.[42] Aaliyah also became the spokesperson for Tommy Hilfiger Corporation.[43] In 1997 Aaliyah performed the Christmas carol What Child Is This at the annual holiday special Christmas in Washington.[44] She contributed on the soundtrack album for the Fox Animation Studios animated feature Anastasia, performing a cover version of \"Journey to the Past\" which earned songwriters Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[26][37][45] Aaliyah performed the song at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony and became the youngest singer to perform at the event.[46][47] The song \"Are You That Somebody?\" was featured on the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack, which earned Aaliyah her first Grammy Award nomination.[48] The song peaked at number 21 on the Hot 100.[49]",
            "What Is Life\nThe following musicians are believed to have played on \"What Is Life\":[9][26]",
            "Shel Silverstein\nSilverstein had a popular following on Dr. Demento's radio show. Among his best-known comedy songs were \"Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout (Would Not Take The Garbage Out)\", \"The Smoke-Off\" (a tale of a contest to determine who could roll\u2014or smoke\u2014marijuana joints faster), \"I Got Stoned and I Missed It\" and \"Stacy Brown Got Two.\" He wrote \"The Father of a Boy Named Sue\", in which he tells the story from the original song from the father's point of view, and the 1962 song \"Boa Constrictor\", sung by a person who is being swallowed by a snake (recorded by the folk group Peter, Paul, and Mary) also recorded by Johnny Cash for his 1966 album Everybody Loves A Nut although it is now better known as a children's playground chant.[citation needed]",

            "Ben E. King\nIn 1990, King and Bo Diddley, along with Doug Lazy, recorded a revamped hip hop version of the Monotones' 1958 hit song \"Book of Love\" for the soundtrack of the movie Book of Love. He also recorded a children's album, I Have Songs In My Pocket, written and produced by children's music artist Bobby Susser in 1998, which won the Early Childhood News Directors' Choice Award and Dr. Toy's/the Institute for Childhood Resources Award. King performed \"Stand by Me\" on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2007. Ahmet Ertegun said, \"King is one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll and rhythm and blues.\"[13]",
            "What You Waiting For?\nWelsh indie pop singer Marina and the Diamonds covered \"What You Waiting For?\" during some of her early live performances in 2009.[62][63] Mary Bellamy of Drowned in Sound referred to her debut album The Family Jewels (2010) as \"an extended album length re-write\" of \"What You Waiting For?\".[64]",
            "What Is Life\nEnglish born Australian pop singer Olivia Newton-John recorded \"What Is Life\", along with a version of Harrison's All Things Must Pass track \"Behind That Locked Door\",[82] for her 1972 album Olivia.[83] The song was arranged and produced by Bruce Welch of the Shadows and John Farrar,[84] who was Newton-John's regular producer and collaborator during the 1970s.[85]",
            "Joni Mitchell\nIn \"Chinese Cafe\", from the 1982 album Wild Things Run Fast, Mitchell sang, \"Your kids are coming up straight / My child's a stranger / I bore her / But I could not raise her.\" These lyrics did not receive wide attention at the time. The existence of Mitchell's daughter was not publicly known until 1993, when a roommate from Mitchell's art-school days in the 1960s sold the story of the adoption to a tabloid magazine.[35][36] By that time, Mitchell's daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, had already begun a search for her biological parents. Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997.[37] After the reunion, Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting, and she later identified her daughter's birth and her inability to take care of her as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had really begun. When she could not express herself to the person she wanted to talk to, she became attuned to the whole world and she began to write personally.",

            "Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\nThe meaning and references in the song have long provoked debate. In a July 20, 1972 interview for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau asked Simon: \"What is it that the mama saw? The whole world wants to know.\" Simon replied \"I have no idea what it is... Something sexual is what I imagine, but when I say 'something', I never bothered to figure out what it was. Didn't make any difference to me.\" This implies that Simon left the crime up to the imagination of the listener, allowing each person who listens to the song to draw their own conclusion from their own thoughts and experiences. This has not stopped speculation on a definite interpretation: commentators have detected references to recreational drug use, and believe that the mother saw the boy buying drugs. More recently, in October 2010, Simon described the song as \"a bit of inscrutable doggerel\",[1] while the \"radical priest\" has been interpreted as a reference to Daniel Berrigan,[2][3][4] who was featured on the cover of Time on January 25, 1971,[5] near when the song was written.",
            "What Is Love\nIn 2016, Belgian DJ Lost Frequencies released a cover titled \"What Is Love 2016\", as a single from his debut album Less Is More.[74] It was actually already produced back in 2014 as a remix for Jaymes Young's cover version of \"What is Love\". This version was remade for the album and became a hit on a number of European singles charts and topped the Belgian Ultratop Official Singles Chart.",
            "What Is Life\n\"What Is Life\" was included on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison as well as 2009's Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison.[64] The song has also been featured in a number of popular movies: Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), during the \"May 11, 1980\" sequence; Tom Shadyac's Patch Adams (1998); and, more recently, Sam Mendes' Away We Go (2009).[65] In late 2012, \"What Is Life\" was used in advance promotion for the film This Is 40, directed by Judd Apatow,[66] although it was omitted from the accompanying soundtrack album.[67] According to Rolling Stone: \"Today, many people know it merely as a song from all those soundtracks: it's in This Is 40, Patch Adams, Goodfellas and many more. It's almost as ubiquitous as 'Let My Love Open the Door' or 'Solsbury Hill.'\"[62] In Scorsese's 2011 documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World, \"What Is Life\" plays over a sequence of 1969 photos of Harrison \u2013 with, variously, Preston, Jackie Lomax, the Plastic Ono Band, Clapton and Ravi Shankar \u2013 immediately before which, archive footage shows him discussing the restrictions he felt within the Beatles and how the band \"had to implode\".[68]",
            "Eyes That See in the Dark\nJust after Barry Gibb contributed producing the Heartbreaker album, he and Rogers met later in the year and it was then that Rogers asked about some songs and that song was the title track. The other songs in this album was written in late 1982 and recorded in early 1983. Gibb recorded demos for Rogers while working with the Bee Gees for the 1983 film Staying Alive until April 1983, as Rogers started to record this album in May the same year.[2] Also in 1983, when Maurice participated in Robin Gibb's album How Old Are You?.",
            "What's Up? (song)\nThe title does not appear in the song's lyrics. However, the phrase \"what's going on?\" is prominently included in the chorus. The title was chosen to avoid confusion with Marvin Gaye's 1971 song \"What's Going On\".[2] Linda Perry told Rolling Stone that she hated the song's production.[3] Perry revealed on Behind the Music that she hated David Tickle's reworked version (with different lyrics) intended to be used for their album. Perry told Jimmy Iovine she hated Tickle's reworked version; Iovine agreed preferring Perry's demo version over Tickle's reworked version.

During the early years of Magnum, P.I., Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and playboy. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the Magnum, P.I. producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters.[138] He also, in this penultimate year released a music single, titled \"I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old)\", which he recorded under Italian label Compagnia Generale del Disco.

Live, they began recording songs for what was to be the follow-up studio album to 1976's Children of the World. Then the call came from Robert Stigwood requesting songs for a movie he was producing. The Bee Gees obliged and gave him five songs, one of which was \"How Deep Is Your Love\". This track was written mainly by Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb. Barry worked out the melody with keyboard player Blue Weaver, though he is not credited officially as a songwriter here. Co-producer Albhy Galuten later admits the contribution of Weaver on this track, \"One song where Blue [Weaver] had a tremendous amount of input. There was a lot of things from his personality. That's one where his contribution was quite significant, not in a songwriting sense, though when you play piano, it's almost like writing the song. Blue had a lot of influence in the piano structure of that song\".[6]",

He did it again during his 1990 Nude tour and during his shows in 2015 still stopping halfway through the song still asking \"Who wrote this?\". There was a dispute regarding the paternity of the music. Prince believed Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis used an old demo he did with them in the early days of the Time.[73] He performed \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" again in late 2013 during shows in Uncasville, Connecticut.[74] Jackson's sister La Toya Jackson sampled the song on her song \"Wild Side\" from her 1991 album No Relations.[75] The song was interpolated for a medley sung in the 1993 comedy Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, and was covered by the American soul and funk band Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings in 2002 for their debut album, Dap Dippin' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings.[76][77] In 2017, singer-songwriter Katy Perry performed a medley of the song with her song \"Bon App\u00e9tit\" as part of her Witness: The Tour. In 2017, WWE color-commentator Corey Graves referenced this song in his commentary for the pre-show match between Mojo Rawley and Zach Ryder during Clash of Champions.

Ballew began writing original songs and digging up nursery rhymes and folk songs in the public domain to interpret and make his own.[2] The first album, Here I Am!, was recorded during the summer of 2008 and released in February 2009.",

The Judy Collins version can be heard in the 1968 film The Subject Was Roses and the 1999 film A Walk on the Moon. The Nina Simone version is used in the 2002 film The Dancer Upstairs. In the 2011 Broadway production of Jerusalem by Jez Butterworth, the song is played in its entirety towards the end of the final act. A young girl puts an LP record on a turntable and the song plays as Mark Rylance's character, Johnny Byron, dances with her and is then brutally beaten by the girl's stepfather and his brothers. The version used is the live recording from BBC Radio Sounds of the Seventies, recorded September 11, 1973. The actress Lucy Hale sings it in an episode of the TV show Pretty Little Liars.

The Bon Jovi music video \"Have a Nice Day\" is also similar to both the advertisement and this video.

            "Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)\nWhose Line Is It Anyway? was created by Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson in 1988 as a radio show on BBC Radio 4 in the United Kingdom. This early incarnation of the show is notable as being the origin of its tradition of having the performers read the credits in an amusing style; as it was a radio show, it was necessary for somebody to read the credits, and it was decided that it might as well be done as part of the program, rather than being done by a traditional BBC Radio announcer. This approach to reading credits was pioneered by the earlier BBC radio show I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again. Indeed, the title of the show itself is a comedic riposte to another radio show, What's My Line, merged with the title of a 1972 teleplay (and eventual theatrical play) Whose Life Is It Anyway?.",

In the 1930 movie Cracked Nuts, comedians Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey examine a map of a mythical kingdom with dialogue like this: \"What is next to Which.\" \"What is the name of the town next to Which?\" \"Yes.\" In British music halls, comedian Will Hay performed a routine in the early 1930s (and possibly earlier) as a schoolmaster interviewing a schoolboy named Howe who came from Ware but now lives in Wye. By the early 1930s, a \"Baseball Routine\" had become a standard bit for burlesque comics across the United States.

I didn't have time to ask why and I still don't have a clue.\"[4] Cartwright also commented that when she first found out she would be voicing Nelson, \"I asked myself, 'What does a bully sound like?'

In the song, a young man is traveling the USA and searching for his soul, like, for example, the young teenaged rock guitarist Eugene, the principal character of the teen-musical movie Crossroads, who is referenced in this song in the person of the young Tom Snyder.

The music in the beginning of the song is taken from the trailer of the Wes Craven film, The Last House on the Left. The spoken words \"What are you thinking about?/The same thing you are\" at the beginning of the verses are taken from the 1971 film Daughters of Darkness (a dialogue between the characters played by Delphine Seyrig and Andrea Rau). In this song, Zombie sings, \"Goldfoot's machine creates another fiend so beautiful they make you kill\". This relates to the villain played by Vincent Price in the 1965 film Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine and the 1966 film Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs.

            "List of NBA players with most championships\nThis is a list of NBA players with most championships won as a player. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a major professional basketball league in North America. It was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1] The league adopted its current name at the start of the 1949\u201350\u00a0season when it merged with the National Basketball League (NBL).[2] The NBA Finals is the championship series for the NBA and the conclusion of the sport's postseason. The winning team of the series receives the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Players from the winning team usually receive championship rings from the team honoring their contribution.[3] However, in some rare occasion, the teams opted to give other commemorative items, such as wrist watches, instead of rings.[4][5] The number of championships won by NBA superstars is often used as a measurement of their greatness.[6]",
            "LeBron James\nMany basketball analysts, coaches, fans, and current and former players consider James to be one of the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall.[d] He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[39] With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span.[237] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[66][238] James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that his supporting casts were usually poor and, despite the fact that James had played well, his team was defeated by superior competition.[239][240][241]",
            "History of the Los Angeles Lakers\nDespite topping the league with a 67\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 record in the regular season, the Lakers found themselves struggling in the playoffs, needing all five games to knock off the Sacramento Kings and coming back from 15 points down in the fourth quarter of Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against Portland. The Indiana Pacers, coached by the Lakers' old nemesis, Larry Bird, proved to be slightly less of a problem, however, and in six games, the Lakers claimed their first NBA championship since 1988. Shaquille O'Neal picked up both MVP and Finals MVP awards in 2000. Having also shared the 2000 All-Star Game MVP award, he was only the third player in NBA history to win all three awards in the same season. Kobe Bryant was named to the NBA All-Defensive Team, the youngest player to earn the honor. Bryant had blossomed under Coach Jackson, as had Lakers role players such as Derek Fisher, Rick Fox and Robert Horry.[citation needed]",
            "Michael Jordan\nWith five regular-season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell\u2014only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated NBA player. Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting a record 10 times, and was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[159] Since 1976, the year of the NBA's merger with the American Basketball Association,[160] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[161] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[162]",
            "Kobe Bryant\nWith career averages of 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game,[297] he is considered one of the most complete players in NBA history.[347] He was the first player in NBA history to have at least 30,000 career points and 6,000 career assists,[335] and is one of only four players with 25,000 points, 6,000 rebounds and 6,000 assists.[348] Bryant led the NBA in scoring during the 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307 seasons.[8] His 81-point performance against Toronto in 2006 was the second-highest in NBA history,[349] behind only Chamberlain's 100. He has scored at least 50 points 24 times in his career, which is third in league history behind Jordan (31) and Chamberlain (118);[268] six times Bryant scored at least 60.[350] He was just the third player in NBA history to average 40 points in a calendar month, which he has accomplished four times.[h] Bryant was voted the league MVP in 2008 and led his team to the 2008 NBA Finals as the first seed in the Western Conference.[351] In the 2008 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. men's basketball team, occasionally referred to as \"The Redeem Team\".[352] He won another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He led the Lakers to two more championships in 2009 and 2010, winning the Finals MVP award on both occasions.",
            "Fab Five (University of Michigan)\nFour of the five members went on to play in the NBA. Ray Jackson was the only player of the five to never suit up in the NBA. Jimmy King played two seasons. Juwan Howard was a one-time NBA All-Star and won two NBA championship rings with the Miami Heat. Jalen Rose grew as a player between 1999 and 2003, leading the Indiana Pacers in scoring the year they reached the NBA Finals (2000). Chris Webber was an NBA All-Star and the leading scorer on the Sacramento Kings team that reached the western conference finals (2002). As a member of the Miami Heat, Juwan Howard became the first and only member of the Fab Five to win an NBA Championship in 2012. He did not play in the Finals until the final minutes of Game 5, when Miami defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder to win the series 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.",
            "NBA Coach of the Year Award\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 40 different coaches. The most recent award winner is Houston Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni. Gregg Popovich, Don Nelson and Pat Riley have each won the award three times, while Hubie Brown, D'Antoni, Bill Fitch, Cotton Fitzsimmons and Gene Shue have each won it twice. No coach has won consecutive Coach of the Year awards. Riley is the only coach to be named Coach of the Year with three different franchises.[2] Larry Bird is the only recipient to have also been named MVP as a player. Tom Heinsohn, Bill Sharman, and Lenny Wilkens are the only recipients to have been inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as both player and coach. Johnny Kerr is the only person to win the award with a losing record (33\u201348 with the Chicago Bulls in 1966\u201367). Kerr was honored because he had guided the Bulls to the NBA Playoffs in their first season in the league.[3] Doc Rivers is the only person to win the award despite his team not making the playoffs (41\u201341 with the Orlando Magic in 1999\u20132000). Only five recipients also coached the team that won the championship the same season: Red Auerbach, Red Holzman, Bill Sharman, Phil Jackson, and Gregg Popovich. Popovich is the only NBA Coach of the Year recipient to win the championship in the same season twice, winning the NBA title with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003 and 2014.",
            "1992 NBA Finals\nThe Bulls won their third straight championship in the 1992\u201393 season, winning 57 games and defeating the Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. In the offseason that preceded Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen played for the Dream Team that won the gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics, making them the first players to win NBA championship and Olympic gold medal in the same year (Pippen would achieve this feat again in 1996). That team also included Blazers guard Clyde Drexler. This made Jordan, Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks and Chris Mullin of the Golden State Warriors the only players to have won Olympic gold medals as both amateurs and professionals, having played for Team USA in Los Angeles.[6][7]",
            "List of National Basketball Association seasons\nThe best single regular season record was recorded by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015\u20132016\u00a0season. In that season, the Warriors recorded 73 wins and 9 losses with a winning percentage of .890, eclipsing the 1995\u20131996 Chicago Bulls, though the Bulls went on to win the Eastern Conference and the NBA championship. The Bulls and the Warriors are the only teams to win at least 70 games in a single season.[3] In the 1995\u201396 season, the Bulls achieved several awards and honors: Michael Jordan won the scoring title, the regular season Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, the All-Star Game MVP Award and the Finals MVP Award; Dennis Rodman won the rebounding title; Toni Kuko\u010d won the Sixth Man of the Year Award; Jordan and Scottie Pippen were named in the All-NBA First Team; Jordan, Pippen and Rodman were named in the NBA All-Defensive First Team; and coach Phil Jackson won the Coach of the Year Award.[4]",

            "List of NBA players with most championships\nBoston Celtics center Bill Russell holds the record for the most NBA championships won with 11 titles during his 13-year playing career.[7] He won his first championship with the Boston Celtics in his rookie year. Afterwards, he went on to win ten championships in the next 12 years, including eight consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966.[8] He won the last two championships in 1968 and 1969 as player-coach.[7] Russell's teammate, Sam Jones, won ten championships from 1959 to 1969, the second most in NBA history.[9] Four Celtics players, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Satch Sanders and John Havlicek, won eight championships each.[10][11][12][13] Two other Celtics, Jim Loscutoff and Frank Ramsey, won seven championships each.[14][15][16] Four players, Bob Cousy, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, won six championships each.[17][18] Jordan and Pippen are members of the Chicago Bulls team who won three consecutive championships twice in the 1990s.[19][20] George Mikan won two championships in the NBL before it merged with the BAA to form the NBA, and won five championships in the NBA.",

            "1979 NBA draft\nMagic Johnson from Michigan State University, one of the \"hardship\" players, was selected first overall by the Los Angeles Lakers. Johnson, who had just finished his sophomore season in college, became the first underclassman to be drafted first overall.[5] He went on to win the NBA championship with the Lakers in his rookie season. He also won the Finals Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the first rookie ever to win the award. He spent his entire 13-year career with the Lakers and won five NBA championships. He also won three Most Valuable Player Awards, three Finals Most Valuable Player Awards, ten consecutive All-NBA Team selections and twelve All-Star Game selections.[6] For his achievements, he has been inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[7] He was also named to the list of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History announced at the league's 50th anniversary in 1996.[8] After retiring as a player, Johnson went on to have a brief coaching career as an interim head coach of the Lakers in 1994.[9]",
            "Kobe Bryant\nAt 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on February 1, 2010, when he surpassed Jerry West. Following his second year in the league, Bryant was chosen to start every All-Star Game until his retirement for a record 18 consecutive appearances, and his four All-Star MVP Awards are tied for the most in NBA history. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. Sporting News and TNT named Bryant the top NBA player of the 2000s.",
            "2009 NBA Finals\nThe series was the third straight championship that the Lakers clinched on the road (after 2001 and 2002); the last time the Lakers clinched the championship at home was in 2000. With their team's win, Pau Gasol became the first Spaniard, and D. J. Mbenga the first Belgian Congolese player, to win an NBA championship. Bill and Luke Walton became the third father and son pair to each win a championship as a player; the other father\u00e2\u20ac\u201cson combinations are Matt Guokas, Sr. (1947) with Matt Jr. (1967) and Rick Barry (1975) with son Brent (2005 and 2007). Kobe Bryant averaged 32.4 points and 7.4 assists in this series, which was the best combination of those categories since Jerry West averaged 37.9 points and 7.4 assists (1969).",
            "Larry Bird\nBird, a wing who played the small forward and power forward positions, was nominated to twelve All-Star teams. He won two NBA Finals MVP and three regular-season MVP awards, all consecutively, a feat only equaled by Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.",
            "Kobe Bryant\nIn 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault in Colorado, but the charges were eventually dropped, and a civil suit was settled out of court. After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers, and he led the NBA in scoring during the 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto Raptors, the second most points scored in a single game in league history behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant was awarded the regular season's Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 2008. After losing in the 2008 NBA Finals, he led the Lakers to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, earning the Finals MVP Award on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when the 34-year-old Bryant suffered a torn Achilles tendon. Although he recovered, his play was limited the following two years by season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively. Citing his physical decline, he announced that he would be retiring after the 2015\u201316 season.",

Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an \"international\" player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.[8] Parker and Nowitzki are the only winners to have been trained totally outside the U.S.; Olajuwon played college basketball at Houston and Duncan at Wake Forest.

            "Methods used to study memory\nHermann Ebbinghaus began the scientific study of human memory with this treatise On Memory is 1885.[2] Ebbinghaus experimented on himself by testing his own ability to memorize lists of randomly arranged syllables presented at regular pace of 2.5 syllables per second. He would record how long it took him to memorize a list of syllables and also how quickly he would lose the memorization. With this data, he traced learning and forgetting curves. Ebbinghaus also collected data on his ability to memorize at different times of the day and under different conditions. His work later influenced G.E. M\u00c3\u00bcller who continued the tradition of lists of items to conduct memory experiments on human subjects and using behavioral data to develop models of memory.[3] The two most common types of memory studied using these methods are recognition and recall.",
            "Forgetting curve\nThe forgetting curve supports one of the seven kinds of memory failures: transience, which is the process of forgetting that occurs with the passage of time.[2]",
            "Amnesia\nFrench psychologist Theodule-Armand Ribot was among the first scientists to study amnesia. He proposed Ribot's Law which states that there is a time gradient in retrograde amnesia. The law follows a logical progression of memory loss due to disease. First, a patient loses the recent memories, then personal memories, and finally intellectual memories. He implied that the most recent memories were lost first.[29]",
            "Memory error\nTransience refers to forgetting what occurs with the passage of time.[3] Transience occurs during the storage phase of memory, after an experience has been encoded and before it is retrieved.[3] As time passes, the quality of our memory also changes, deteriorating from specific to more general.[3] German philosopher named Hermann Ebbinghaus decided to measure his own memory for lists of nonsense syllables at various times after studying them. He decided to draw out a curve of his forgetting pattern over time. He realized that there is a rapid drop-off in retention during the first tests and there is a slower rate of forgetting later on.[3] Therefore, transience denotes the gradual change of a specific knowledge or idea into more general memories.[4]",

            "Second-language attrition\nHermann Ebbinghaus contributed a lot to the research of the memory of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).",
            "Forgetting curve\nIn 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus collected data to plot a forgetting curve. Today, we approximate forgetting with an exponential curve[3]:",
            "Forgetting curve\nHermann Ebbinghaus ran a limited, incomplete study on himself and published his hypothesis in 1885 as \u00dcber das Ged\u00e4chtnis (later translated into English as Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology). Ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables, such as \"WID\" and \"ZOF\" (CVCs or Consonant-Vowel-Consonant) by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results. He plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the \"forgetting curve\". From his discovery regarding the \"forgetting curve\", Ebbinghaus came up with the effects of \"overlearning\". Essentially, if you practiced something more than what is usually necessary to memorize it, you would have effectively achieved overlearning. Overlearning ensures that information is more impervious to being lost or forgotten, and the forgetting curve for this overlearned material is shallower.[4]",
            "Memory improvement\nAristotle wrote a treatise about memory: De memoria et reminiscentia. To improve recollection, he advised that a systematic search should be made and that practice was helpful. He suggested grouping the items to be remembered in threes and then concentrating upon the central member of each triad (group of three).[32]",
            "Memory consolidation\nMemory consolidation was first referred to in the writings of the renowned Roman teacher of rhetoric Quintillian.  He noted the \"curious fact\u2026 that the interval of a single night will greatly increase the strength of the memory,\" and presented the possibility that \"\u2026 the power of recollection .. undergoes a process of ripening and maturing during the time which intervenes.\"  The process of consolidation was later proposed based on clinical data illustrated in 1882 by Ribot\u2019s Law of Regression, \"progressive destruction advances progressively from the unstable to the stable\". This idea was elaborated on by William H. Burnham a few years later in a paper on amnesia integrating findings from experimental psychology and neurology.  Coining of the term \"consolidation\" is credited to the German researchers M\u00fcller and Alfons Pilzecker who rediscovered the concept that memory takes time to fixate or undergo \"Konsolidierung\" in their studies conducted between 1892 and 1900.[1] The two proposed the perseveration-consolidation hypothesis after they found that new information learned could disrupt information previously learnt if not enough time had passed to allow the old information to be consolidated.[3] This led to the suggestion that new memories are fragile in nature but as time passes they become solidified.[3]",
            "Interference theory\nIn 1924, James J. Jenkins and Karl Dallenbach showed that everyday experiences can interfere with memory with an experiment that resulted in retention being better over a period of sleep than over the same amount of time devoted to activity.[4] The United States again made headway in 1932 with John A. McGeoch suggesting that decay theory should be replaced by an interference theory.[4] The most recent major paradigm shift came when Underwood proposed that proactive inhibition is more important or meaningful than retroactive inhibition in accounting for forgetting.[5]",
            "Forgetting curve\nHe went on to hypothesize that basic training in mnemonic techniques can help overcome those differences in part. He asserted that the best methods for increasing the strength of memory are:",
            "Recall (memory)\nIn 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus created nonsense syllables, combinations of letters that do not follow grammatical rules and have no meaning, to test his own memory. He would memorize a list of nonsense syllables and then test his recall of that list over varying time periods. He discovered that memory loss occurred rapidly over the first few hours or days, but showed a more steady, gradual decline over subsequent days, weeks, and months. Furthermore, Ebbinghaus discovered that multiple learning, over-learning, and spacing study times increased retention of information.[7] Ebbinghaus' research influenced much of the research conducted on memory and recall throughout the twentieth century.",
            "Psychology\nWolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka co-founded the school of Gestalt psychology (not to be confused with the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls). This approach is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes. Rather than breaking down thoughts and behavior into smaller elements, as in structuralism, the Gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important, and differs from the sum of its parts. Other 19th-century contributors to the field include the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, a pioneer in the experimental study of memory, who developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting at the University of Berlin,[32] and the Russian-Soviet physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed \"classical conditioning\" and applied to human beings.[33]",
            "Reason\nDonald like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in On Memory and Recollection), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek anamn\u0113sis, normally translated as \"recollection\" was opposed to mneme or memory. Memory, shared with some animals,[50] requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also that something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of eikasia[51] \"...but nothing except man is able to recollect.\"[52] Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, \"To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting.\"[53] Donald calls the same thing autocueing, which he explains as follows:[54] \"Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues \u2013 probably the earliest form of representational thinking.\"",
            "Prospective memory\nHarrington et al. (1998) found that neural areas ranging from the inferior parietal cortex to the frontal gyri are involved in temporal monitoring during time-based prospective memory tasks.[23] Patients with damage to these areas of the brain had difficulty judging duration and frequency of auditory tones that were presented. Keeping track of information over time is important for prospective memory, remembering intentions to perform in the future.",
            "Forgetting curve\nThe forgetting curve hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time. This curve shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it.[1] A related concept is the strength of memory that refers to the durability that memory traces in the brain. The stronger the memory, the longer period of time that a person is able to recall it. A typical graph of the forgetting curve purports to show that humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks unless they consciously review the learned material.",
            "Muscle memory\nAs Edward S. Casey notes in Remembering, Second Edition: A Phenomenological Study, declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period. \"The activity of the past, in short, resides in its habitual enactment in the present.\"",
            "Amnesia\nHenry Molaison, formerly known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957.[30] He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident at the age of nine. Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place.[31] Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes.[32] Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.[33]",
            "Hermann Ebbinghaus\nEbbinghaus made several findings that are still relevant and supported to this day. First, arguably his most famous finding, the forgetting curve. The forgetting curve describes the exponential loss of information that one has learned.[7] The sharpest decline occurs in the first twenty minutes and the decay is significant through the first hour. The curve levels off after about one day.",
            "Time\nIn Book 11 of his Confessions, St. Augustine of Hippo ruminates on the nature of time, asking, \"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not.\" He begins to define time by what it is not rather than what it is,[62] an approach similar to that taken in other negative definitions. However, Augustine ends up calling time a \"distention\" of the mind (Confessions 11.26) by which we simultaneously grasp the past in memory, the present by attention, and the future by expectation.",
            "Interference theory\nThe next major advancement came from American psychologist Benton J. Underwood in 1957. Underwood revisited the classic Ebbinghaus learning curve and found that much of the forgetting was due to interference from previously learned materials [3]",
            "Forgetting curve\nwhere \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n is retrievability (a measure of how easy it is to retrieve a piece of information from memory), \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n is stability of memory (determines how fast \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n falls over time in the absence of training, testing or other recall), and \n\n\n\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t}\n\n is time.",
            "Encoding (memory)\nEncoding is still relatively new and unexplored but origins of encoding date back to age old philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato. A major figure in the history of encoding is Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1909). Ebbinghaus was a pioneer in the field of memory research. Using himself as a subject he studied how we learn and forget information by repeating a list of nonsense syllables to the rhythm of a metronome until they were committed to his memory.[38] These experiments lead him to suggest the learning curve.[38] He used these relatively meaningless words so that prior associations between meaningful words would not influence learning. He found that lists that allowed associations to be made and semantic meaning was apparent were easier to recall. Ebbinghaus' results paved the way for experimental psychology in memory and other mental processes.",
            "Mnemonic\nAncient Greeks and Romans distinguished between two types of memory: the \"natural\" memory and the \"artificial\" memory. The former is inborn, and is the one that everyone uses instinctively. The latter in contrast has to be trained and developed through the learning and practice of a variety of mnemonic techniques.",
            "Forgetting curve\nSpending time each day to remember information, such as that for exams, will greatly decrease the effects of the forgetting curve. Reviewing material in the first 24 hours after learning information is the optimum time to re-read notes and reduce the amount of knowledge forgotten.[1]",
            "Reincarnation\nTh\u00e9odore Flournoy was among the first to study a claim of past-life recall in the course of his investigation of the medium H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Smith, published in 1900, in which he defined the possibility of cryptomnesia in such accounts.[125] Carl Gustav Jung, like Flournoy based in Switzerland, also emulated him in his thesis based on a study of cryptomnesia in psychism. Later Jung would emphasise the importance of the persistence of memory and ego in psychological study of reincarnation: \"This concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality... (that) one is able, at least potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one's own....\"[122] Hypnosis, used in psychoanalysis for retrieving forgotten memories, was eventually tried as a means of studying the phenomenon of past life recall.",
            "Hermann Ebbinghaus\nPrior to Ebbinghaus, most contributions to the study of memory were undertaken by philosophers and centered on observational description and speculation. For example, Immanuel Kant used pure description to discuss recognition and its components and Sir Francis Bacon claimed that the simple observation of the rote recollection of a previously learned list was \"no use to the art\" of memory. This dichotomy between descriptive and experimental study of memory would resonate later in Ebbinghaus's life, particularly in his public argument with former colleague Wilhelm Dilthey. However, more than a century before Ebbinghaus, Johann Andreas Segner invented the \"Segner-wheel\" to see the length of after-images by seeing how fast a wheel with a hot coal attached had to move for the red ember circle from the coal to appear complete. (see iconic memory)",
            "Memory\nStudy of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy. A notable initial success was the association of APOE with memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease. The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues. One of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the gene KIBRA,[41] which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period.",
            "Amnesia\nAnother coping mechanism is taking advantage of technological assistance, such as a personal digital device to keep track of day-to-day tasks. Reminders can be set up for appointments, when to take medications, birthdays and other important events. Many pictures can also be stored to help amnesiacs remember names of friends, family and co-workers.[25] Notebooks, wall calendars, pill reminders and photographs of people and places are low-tech memory aids that can help as well.[26]",
            "Muscle memory\nIn the early stages of empirical research of motor memory Edward Thorndike, a leading pioneer in the study of motor memory, was among the first to acknowledge learning can occur without conscious awareness.[7] One of the earliest and most notable studies regarding the retention of motor skills was by Hill, Rejall, and Thorndike, who showed savings in relearning typing skills after a 25-year period with no practice.[4] Findings related to the retention of learned motor skills have been continuously replicated in studies, suggesting that through subsequent practice, motor learning is stored in the brain as memory. This is why performing skills such as riding a bike or driving a car are effortlessly and 'subconsciously' executed, even if someone had not performed these skills in a long period of time.[4]",
            "Waiting for Godot\nVladimir stands through most of the play whereas Estragon sits down numerous times and even dozes off. \"Estragon is inert and Vladimir restless.\"[18] Vladimir looks at the sky and muses on religious or philosophical matters. Estragon \"belongs to the stone\",[19] preoccupied with mundane things, what he can get to eat and how to ease his physical aches and pains; he is direct, intuitive. He finds it hard to remember but can recall certain things when prompted, e.g., when Vladimir asks: \"Do you remember the Gospels?\"[20] Estragon tells Vladimir about the coloured maps of the Holy Land and that he planned to honeymoon by the Dead Sea; it is his short-term memory that is poorest and points to the fact that he may, in fact, be suffering from Alzheimer's disease.[21] Al Alvarez writes: \"But perhaps Estragon's forgetfulness is the cement binding their relationship together. He continually forgets, Vladimir continually reminds him; between them they pass the time.\"[22] They have been together for fifty years but when asked\u2013by Pozzo\u2013they do not reveal their actual ages.",
            "Recall (memory)\nThe Argentinean author, Jorge Luis Borges wrote the short story Funes the Memorious in 1944. It depicts the life of Ireneo Funes, a fictional character who falls off his horse and experiences a head injury. After this accident, Funes has total recall abilities. He is said to recall an entire day with no mistakes, but this feat of recall takes him an entire day to accomplish. It is said that Borges was ahead of his time in his description of memory processes in this story, as it was not until the 1950s and research on the patient HM that some of what the author describes began to be understood.[80] A more recent instance of total recall in literature is found in is in Stieg Larsson's books The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, in which the lead character, Lisbeth Salander remembers anything she reads, indicating she has total recall ability. Another example is in Dan Brown's books The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, in which the main character, Dr. Robert Langdon, a religious iconography and symbology professor at Harvard University, has almost total recall ability. In The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime by Mark Haddon, the main character, Christopher Boone, is a 15-year-old autistic boy with total recall abilities.[81]",
            "The Seven Sins of Memory\nThis form of memory breakdown involves problems at the point where attention and memory interface. Common errors of this type include misplacing keys or eyeglasses, or forgetting appointments, because at the time of encoding sufficient attention was not paid to what would later need to be recalled.",
            "Short-term memory\nWhatever the cause or causes of forgetting over the short-term may be, there is consensus that it severely limits the amount of new information that we can retain over brief periods of time. This limit is referred to as the finite capacity of short-term memory. The capacity of short-term memory is often called memory span, in reference to a common procedure of measuring it. In a memory span test, the experimenter presents lists of items (e.g. digits or words) of increasing length. An individual's span is determined as the longest list length that he or she can recall correctly in the given order on at least half of all trials.",
            "Autobiographical memory\nGeneral events are more specific than lifetime periods and encompass single representations of repeated events or a sequence of related events.[2] General events group into clusters with a common theme, so that when one memory of a general event is recalled, it cues the recall of other related events in memory. These clusters of memories often form around the theme of either achieving or failing to achieve personal goals.[2] Clusters of general events that fall under the category of \"first-time\" achievements or occasions seem to have a particular vividness, such as the first time kissing a romantic partner, or the first time going to a ball game.[4] These memories of goal-attainment pass on important information about the self, such as how easily a skill can be acquired, or an individual's success and failure rates for certain tasks.[2]",
            "John B. Watson\nThis, according to Watson, is the start of memory. All of the ideas previously mentioned are what Watson says make up our memory, and that we carry the memory we develop throughout our lives. Watson tells the tale of Mr. Addison Sims and his friend in order to illustrate these ideas. A friend of Mr. Sims' sees Mr. Sims on a street sidewalk and exclaims: \"Upon my life! Addison Sims of Seattle! I haven\u2019t seen you since the World\u2019s Fair in Chicago. Do you remember the gay parties we used to have in the old Windermere Hotel?...\".[28] Even after all of this, Mr. Sims cannot remember the man's name, although they were old friends who used to encounter many of the same people, places, and experiences together. Watson argued that if the two men were to do some of their old shared activities and go to some of the old same places (the stimuli), then the response (or memory) would occur.",
            "Entropy (arrow of time)\nAll phenomena that behave differently in one time direction can ultimately be linked to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This includes the fact that ice cubes melt in hot coffee rather than assembling themselves out of the coffee, that a block sliding on a rough surface slows down rather than speeding up, and that we can remember the past rather than the future. This last phenomenon, called the \"psychological arrow of time\", has deep connections with Maxwell's demon and the physics of information; In fact, it is easy to understand its link to the Second Law of Thermodynamics if one views memory as correlation between brain cells (or computer bits) and the outer world. Since the Second Law of Thermodynamics is equivalent to the growth with time of such correlations, then it states that memory is created as we move towards the future (rather than towards the past).",
            "Alfred Adler\nAdler placed great emphasis upon the interpretation of early memories in working with patients and school children, writing that, \"Among all psychic expressions, some of the most revealing are the individual's memories.\"[28] Adler viewed memories as expressions of \"private logic\" and as metaphors for an individual's personal philosophy of life or \"lifestyle\". He maintained that memories are never incidental or trivial; rather, they are chosen reminders: \"(A person's) memories are the reminders she carries about with her of her limitations and of the meanings of events. There are no 'chance' memories. Out of the incalculable number of impressions that an individual receives, she chooses to remember only those which she considers, however dimly, to have a bearing on her problems.\"[29]",

Therapists have used strategies such as hypnotherapy, repeated questioning, and bibliotherapy. These strategies may provoke the recovery of nonexistent events or inaccurate memories.[3][12][13][14] A recent report indicates that similar strategies may have produced false memories in several therapies in the century before the modern controversy on the topic which took place in the 1980s and 1990s.[15] Elizabeth Loftus author of the Myth of Repressed Memory: False memories and allegations of Sexual Abuse, writes about how easy it is for her as a therapist to mold people's memories, or prompt them to recall a nonexistent broken glass.[16]",

Some women may experience more memory lapses following the onset of the menopause.[30] In general, more serious problems with memory occur due to traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease.",
            "Sensory memory\nIconic memory. The mental representation of the visual stimuli are referred to as icons (fleeting images.) Iconic memory was the first sensory store to be investigated with experiments dating back as far as 1740. One of the earliest investigations into this phenomenon was by J\u00c3\u00a1n Andrej Segner, a German physicist and mathematician. In his experiment, Segner attached a glowing coal to a cart wheel and rotated the wheel at increasing speed until an unbroken circle of light was perceived by the observer. He calculated that the glowing coal needed to make a complete circle in under 100ms to achieve this effect, which he determined was the duration of this visual memory store. In 1960, George Sperling conducted a study where participants were shown a set of letters for a brief amount of time and were asked to recall the letters they were shown afterwards. Participants were less likely to recall more letters when asked about the whole group of letters, but recalled more when asked about specific subgroups of the whole. These findings suggest that iconic memory in humans has a large capacity, but decays very rapidly [10]. In a 2001 experiment, Vogel et al. presented a display of between 3 and 12 objects. After 900ms, a second display was presented that was either the same or had one object changed. The result was that the participants ability to decide if the two displays were identical was almost perfect with four objects, but steadily declined as the number of items in the display increased above four. This determined the capacity to be around four items.[11] Another study set out to test the idea that visual sensory memory consists of coarse-grained and fine-grained memory traces using a mathematical model to quantify each. The study suggested that the dual-trace model of visual memory out performed single-trace models [12].",

In other words, the psychological arrow of time is intertwined with the thermodynamic arrow of time.",
            "The Seven Sins of Memory\nThe book revolves around the theory that \"the seven sins of memory\" are similar to the Seven deadly sins, and that if one tries to avoid committing these sins, it will help to improve one's ability to remember. Schacter argues that these features of human memory are not necessarily bad, and that they serve a useful purpose in memory. For instance, persistence is one of the sins of memory that can lead to things like post traumatic stress syndrome. However persistence is also necessary for long-term memory, and so it is essential.",
            "Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model\nAt the time of the original publication there was a schism in the field of memory on the issue of a single process or dual-process model of memory, the two processes referring to short-term and long-term memory.[23][25] Atkinson and Shiffrin cite hippocampal lesion studies as compelling evidence for a separation of the two stores.[1] These studies showed that patients with bilateral damage to the hippocampal region had nearly no ability to form new long-term memories though their short-term memory remained intact.[26] One may also be familiar with similar evidence found through the study of Henry Molaison, famously known as H.M., who underwent a severe bilateral medial temporal lobectomy which removed most of his hippocampal regions. These data suggest that there is indeed a clear separation between the short-term and long-term stores.",
            "Methods used to study memory\nIt is usually desirable to study memory in humans because we have the ability to subjectively describe experiences, and have the intellect to perform complex and indirect tests of memory. Lesion studies allow us to reduce the neural mechanisms of memory, and results from finely constructed psychological tests can help us make inferences about how memory works. Neuropsychologists attempt to show that specific behavioural deficits are associated with specific sites of brain damage. The famous case of HM, a man who had both his medial temporal lobes removed resulting in profound amnesia, illustrates how brain damage can tell us a lot about the inner workings of memory. One of the fundamental problems with studying human patients who have already acquired brain damage is the lack of experimental control.[1] Comparisons usually have to be made between individuals; exact lesion location and individual differences cannot be controlled for.",

            "Cognition\nHermann Ebbinghaus (1850\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1909) conducted cognitive studies that mainly examined the function and capacity of human memory. Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words, for instance EAS. He then examined his own personal ability to learn these non-words. He purposely chose non-words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience on what the words might symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them.[9][11] Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non-words he created. One of the reasons, he concluded, was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli and the recitation or recall of same. Ebbinghaus was the first to record and plot a \"learning curve,\" and a \"forgetting curve.\"[12] His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its effect on memory, discussed in subsequent sections.",
            "Memory\nOne of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss, especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. However, memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's (Budson & Price, 2005). Research has revealed that individuals' performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age. Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information;[50] source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information;[51] and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time. Older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books, for example.",

            "The Seven Sins of Memory\nTransience refers to the general deterioration of a specific memory over time. Much more can be remembered of recent events than those further in one's past. This is especially true with episodic memory, because every time an episodic memory is recalled, it is re-encoded within the hippocampus, altering the memory each time one recalls it. Transience is caused because of interference. There are two types of interference: proactive interference (old information inhibits the ability to remember new information), and retroactive interference (new information inhibits the ability to remember old information).",
            "Forgetting curve\nHis premise was that each repetition in learning increases the optimum interval before the next repetition is needed (for near-perfect retention, initial repetitions may need to be made within days, but later they can be made after years). Later research suggested that, other than the two factors Ebbinghaus proposed, higher original learning would also produce slower forgetting.[6]",
            "The Seven Sins of Memory\nSuggestibility is somewhat similar to misattribution, but with the inclusion of overt suggestion. It is the acceptance of a false suggestion made by others. Memories of the past are often influenced by the manner in which they are recalled, and when subtle emphasis is placed on certain aspects which might seem likely to a specific type of memory, those emphasized aspects are sometimes incorporated into the recollection, whether or not they occurred. For example, a person sees a crime being committed by a redheaded man. Subsequently, after reading in the newspaper that the crime was committed by a brown-haired man, the witness \"remembers\" a brown-haired man instead of a redheaded man.",
            "Mnemonic\nThe general name of mnemonics, or memoria technica, was the name applied to devices for aiding the memory, to enable the mind to reproduce a relatively unfamiliar idea, and especially a series of dissociated ideas, by connecting it, or them, in some artificial whole, the parts of which are mutually suggestive.[5] Mnemonic devices were much cultivated by Greek sophists and philosophers and are frequently referred to by Plato and Aristotle. In later times the poet Simonides was credited for development of these techniques, perhaps for no reason other than that the power of his memory was famous. Cicero, who attaches considerable importance to the art, but more to the principle of order as the best help to memory, speaks of Carneades (perhaps Charmades) of Athens and Metrodorus of Scepsis as distinguished examples of people who used well-ordered images to aid the memory. The Romans valued such helps in order to support facility in public speaking.[6]",
            "Neuroanatomy of memory\nThe frontal lobes help a person select out memories that are most relevant on a given occasion. It can coordinate various types of information into a coherent memory trace.[11] For example, the knowledge of the information itself, as well as knowing where information came from must be put together into a single memory representation; this is called source monitoring.[12] Sometimes we experience situations where information becomes separated, such as when we recall something, but cannot remember where we remember it from; this is referred to as a source monitoring error.[12]",

            "Second-language attrition\nAccording to the regression hypothesis, two similar approaches developed. Cohen started to conduct several studies on his own to determine \"whether the last things learned are, in fact, the first things to be forgotten, and whether forgetting entails unlearning in reverse order from the original learning process\" (Cohen 1975: 128). He observed the attrition of Spanish, as the second language, among school children during the summer vacation. Cohen's results supported the regression hypothesis and his last-learned-first-forgotten thesis. It supported the idea that some things, which are learned last, are the first to be forgotten when the learner has no input of the target language anymore.",

In contrast, time-based prospective memory occurs when you remember to carry out a task at a specific time.[5]  An example of this is remembering to phone your sister on her birthday.  Time-based prospective memory is more difficult than event-based prospective memory because there is no environmental cue prompting one to remember to carry out the task at that specific time.[5]",

Numerous aspects of daily life require prospective memory, ranging from ordinary activities such as remembering where to meet a friend, to more important tasks such as remembering what time to take medication.",
            "Long-term memory\nAs long-term memory is subject to fading in the natural forgetting process, maintenance rehearsal (several recalls/retrievals of memory) may be needed to preserve long term memories.[10] Individual retrievals can take place in increasing intervals in accordance with the principle of spaced repetition. This can happen quite naturally through reflection or deliberate recall (also known as recapitulation), often dependent on the perceived importance of the material. Using testing methods as a form of recall can lead to the testing effect, which aids long term memory through information retrieval and feedback.",

While living and working in Paris, he expounded a system of mnemonics in which (as in Wennsshein) the numerical figures are represented by letters chosen due to some similarity to the figure or an accidental connection with it. This alphabet was supplemented by a complicated system of localities and signs. Feinaigle, who apparently did not publish any written documentation of this method, travelled to England in 1811. The following year one of his pupils published The New Art of Memory (1812), giving Feinaigle's system. In addition, it contains valuable historical material about previous systems.",

His cover version of \"Crying Time\", originally recorded by the country artist Buck Owens, reached number 6 on the pop chart and helped Charles win a Grammy Award the following March. In 1967, he had a top-twenty hit with another ballad, \"Here We Go Again\".[32]",

Sullivan himself told Jagger, \"Either the song goes or you go\".[8] A compromise was reached to substitute the words \"let's spend some time together\" in place of \"let's spend the night together\"; Jagger agreed to change the lyrics but ostentatiously rolled his eyes at the TV camera while singing them, as well as Bill Wyman. When the Rolling Stones, following their performance of the song, returned on stage, they were all dressed up in Nazi uniforms with swastikas, which caused Sullivan to angrily order them to return to their dressing rooms to change back into their performance clothes, at which they left the studio altogether.[9] As a result of this incident, Sullivan announced that the Rolling Stones would be banned from performing on his show again.[9] However, the Stones did appear on the show again and performed three songs on 23 November 1969.[10] \nIn April 2006, for their first-ever performance in China, authorities prohibited the group from performing the song due to its \"suggestive lyrics\".[11]",

The artists were put in a huge group and sang the 'Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time' refrain over and over again until it was complete. Having recorded the group, Ure chose Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet to be the first singer into the studio to record his solo part. Hadley admitted that this had been nerve-wracking, knowing that all his contemporaries were watching him.[10] One by one the other assigned singers then did likewise, with Ure taping their efforts and then making notes on which segments would be cut into the final recording. Le Bon, despite having already recorded his part at Ure's house, re-recorded it so he could be part of the moment. Sting also recorded his words again, this time to provide harmony vocals. Despite being lead singers themselves, both Geldof and Ure had already decided that they would not sing any solo lines, although both took part in the 'feed the world' finale. Ure later stated in his autobiography that he was constantly battling with Geldof, and telling him to leave when he would come into the production booth and wrongly tell the artist behind the microphone what to sing.[15]",

She worked on Never Let Me Go's music for four months.[30] Portman said that because of the film's sad themes, she wanted to \"put some hope\" and humanity into the music. It was important to her that there be a \"real emotional heartbeat in the midst of this story.\" Believing that a \"huge sweeping score\" would not have fit Never Let Me Go, she instead worked with a smaller orchestra of no more than 48 players.[30] At the urgent request of the director and the producers, she tried other approaches, such as the use of a child's voice and what was described as a \"big finale cue.\" In the end, they went for a simpler and more subtle approach. Stating that most of the score was written for piano, strings and harp, with solos for violin and cello, she called her score something of a \"chamber piece\". \"If you use a solo instrument, it's like having a voice\", she says.[30] \"It highlights the emotion.\" But, she adds, \"the violin is played with virtually no vibrato, because I didn't ever want it to sound sentimental\".

I Feel Like a Woman!\" and other high-gloss songs \"open with a bubblegum-glam cheerleader shout, then blasts into radio-ready rapture with offhand vocal interjections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c doot-doot-doot scatting, do-si-do rapping, sexy squeaks, sarcastic Alanis Morissette asides.\"[10]",

            "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\nThe title and thus the lyrics of the song were based on Twain's experience while working at Deerhurst Resort in Huntsville, Ontario to provide for her brothers and sisters after their parents died in a car crash. Twain recalls seeing some drag performers working at the resort and credits them as the source of her inspiration. Later in 1993, after being signed to Mercury Nashville and releasing her first album Shania Twain, Twain met Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, whom she would collaborate extensively with and marry at the end of the year. In 1994, while composing songs for what would become her second studio album The Woman in Me, Lange played to Twain a riff he had been working on and Twain sang lyrics for what would become \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\". Speaking of the writing of the song, she stated \"There was no time to waste on ideas that wouldn't make the album, but something like [the song] was just there. I was inspired right off the bat with that one, for example, by a riff Mutt had going, and the lyrics and phrasing just came out of the blue.\"[2]",

It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.'

It was designed by Edwin Lutyens and first planned in 1919 and was completed in 1938, at a time when Ireland had achieved independence. Despite being a monument to people who fought in the British Army, it received cross-party support, partly because the likes of Major General William Bernard Hickie had been Home Rulers. There are a number of other major monuments relevant to the experience of Irish soldiers in World War I, this time based on the European continent; the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium, for example, features the names of many Irish soldiers.[30][31] A second Belgium-based memorial was opened in 1998; the Island of Ireland Peace Park.

            "Remembrance Day\nIn Australia, Remembrance Day is always observed on 11 November, regardless of the day of the week, and is not a public holiday; it is a time when people can pay their respects to the substantial number of soldiers who died in battle. Some institutions observe two-minute's silence at 11\u00a0am through a programme named Read 2 Remember,[5] children read the Pledge of Remembrance by Rupert McCall and teachers deliver specially developed resources to help children understand the significance of the day and the resilience of those who have fought for their country and call on children to also be resilient when facing difficult times. Services are held at 11\u00a0am at war memorials and schools in suburbs and cities across the country, at which the \"Last Post\" is sounded by a bugler and a one-minute silence is observed. In recent decades, Remembrance Day has been largely eclipsed as the national day of war commemoration by ANZAC Day (25 April), which is a public holiday in all states.",

In what is perhaps the most prolonged and complicated air campaign in history, the Battle of Britain contributed significantly to the delay and subsequent indefinite postponement of Hitler's plans for an invasion of the United Kingdom (Operation Sealion). In the House of Commons on 20 August, prompted by the ongoing efforts of the RAF, Prime Minister Winston Churchill eloquently made a speech to the nation, where he said \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\".[13]",

He was killed at 10:50\u00a0am. The last soldier from the UK to die, George Edwin Ellison of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, was killed earlier that morning at around 9:30\u00a0am while scouting on the outskirts of Mons, Belgium.

And finally, American Henry Gunther is generally recognized as the last soldier killed in action in World War I. He was killed 60 seconds before the armistice came into force while charging astonished German troops who were aware the Armistice was nearly upon them. He had been despondent over his recent reduction in rank and was apparently trying to redeem his reputation.[25][26]",

            "Hanging\nThree British subjects were hanged after World War II after having been convicted of having helped Nazi Germany in its war against Britain. John Amery, the son of prominent British politician Leo Amery, became an expatriate in the 1930s, moving to France. He became involved in pre-war fascist politics, remained in what became Vichy France following France's defeat by Germany in 1940 and eventually went to Germany and later the German puppet state in Italy headed by Benito Mussolini. Captured by Italian partisans at the end of the war and handed over to British authorities, Amery was accused of having made propaganda broadcasts for the Nazis and of having attempted to recruit British prisoners of war for a Waffen SS regiment later known as the British Free Corps. Amery pleaded guilty to treason charges on 28 November 1945 [73] and was hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 19 December 1945.[74] William Joyce, an American-born Irishman who had lived in Britain and possessed a British passport, had been involved in pre-war fascist politics in the UK, fled to Nazi Germany just before the war began to avoid arrest by British authorities and became a naturalised German citizen. He made propaganda broadcasts for the Nazis, becoming infamous under the nickname Lord Haw Haw. Captured by British forces in May 1945, he was tried for treason later that year. Although Joyce's defence argued that he was by birth American and thus not subject to being tried for treason, the prosecution successfully argued that Joyce's pre-war British passport meant that he was a subject of the British Crown and he was convicted. After his appeals failed, he was hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 3 January 1946.[75] Theodore Schurch, a British soldier captured by the Nazis who then began working for the Italian and German intelligence services by acting as a spy and informer who would be placed among other British prisoners, was arrested in Rome in March 1945 and tried under the Treachery Act 1940. After his conviction, he was hanged at HM Prison Pentonville on 4 January 1946.[76]",

            "Shot at Dawn Memorial\nThe memorial is to servicemen executed by firing squad during the First World War. It is alleged that soldiers accused of cowardice were often not given fair trials; they were often not properly defended, and some were minors.[3][4] Other sources contend that military law, being based on Roman rather than Common law, appears unfamiliar to civilian eyes but is no less fair.[5][6] It was the court's role to establish facts, for example, not for prosecutors and defenders to argue their cases; and Holmes states \"it was the first duty of the court to ensure the prisoner had every advantage to what he was legally entitled\".[7] If men seemed unrepresented it was because they generally chose to speak in their own defence.[8] The usual cause for their offences has been re-attributed in modern times to post-traumatic stress syndrome and combat stress reaction.[3][4] Another perspective is that the decisions to execute were taken in the heat of war when the commander's job was to keep the army together and fighting.[9]",

Most historians and archeologists today do not regard \"David's Tomb\" there to be the actual burial place of King David. The Chamber of the Holocaust (Martef HaShoah), the precursor of Yad Vashem, is also located on Mount Zion. Another place of interest is the Catholic cemetery where Oskar Schindler, a Righteous Gentile who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews in the Holocaust, is buried.[20] Notable burials in the Protestant cemetery on Mt. Zion include a number of prominent individuals from the 19th and 20th centuries. These include explorers and archaeologists such as Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Charles Frederick Tyrwhitt Drake, James Duncan, Clarence Stanley Fisher, Charles Lambert and James Leslie Starkey; the architect Conrad Schick; and pioneers in the fields of medicine, education, religion, diplomacy and social services such as James Edward Hanauer, Ernest Masterman, John Nicholayson, Paul Palmer, Max Sandreczky, Johann Ludwig Schneller, Horatio G. Spafford, author of the hymn It Is Well With My Soul. Also buried in the cemetery are G. Douglas Young, founder of Jerusalem University College / Institute of Holy Land Studies, and his wife Georgina (Snook) Young.

            "Medieval medicine of Western Europe\nMedieval European medicine became more developed during the Renaissance of the 12th century, when many medical texts both on Ancient Greek medicine and on Islamic medicine were translated from Arabic during the 13th century. The most influential among these texts was Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia written in circa 1030 which summarized the medicine of Greek, Indian and Muslim physicians until that time. The Canon became an authoritative text in European medical education until the early modern period. Other influential texts from Jewish authors include the Liber pantegni by Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, while Arabic authors contributed De Gradibus by Alkindus and Al-Tasrif' by Abulcasis.",
            "Medieval medicine of Western Europe\nThe re-emergence of Botany in the medieval world came about during the sixteenth century. As part of the revival of classical medicine, one of the biggest areas of interest was materia medica: the study of remedial substances. \u201cItalian humanists in the fifteenth century had recovered and translated ancient Greek botanical texts which had been unknown in the West in the Middle Ages or relatively ignored\u201d.[44] Soon after the rise in interest in botany, universities such as Padua and Bologna started to create programs and fields of study; some of these practices including setting up gardens so that students were able to collect and examine plants. \u201cBotany was also a field in which printing made a tremendous impact, through the development of naturalistic illustrated herbals\u201d.[44] During this time period, university practices were highly concerned with the philosophical matters of study in sciences and the liberal arts, \u201cbut by the sixteenth century both scholastic discussion of plants and reliance upon intermediary compendia for plant names and descriptions were increasingly abandoned in favor of direct study of the original texts of classical authors and efforts to reconcile names, descriptions, and plants in nature\u201d.[45] Botanist expanded their knowledge of different plant remedies, seeds, bulbs, uses of dried and living plants through continuous interchange made possible by printing. In sixteenth century medicine, botany was rapidly becoming a lively and fast-moving discipline that held wide universal appeal in the world of doctors, philosophers, and pharmacists.[46]",

            "Scarlet fever\nThe first description of the disease in the medical literature appeared in the 1553 book De Tumoribus praeter Naturam by the Sicilian anatomist and physician Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia, where he referred to it as rossalia. He also made a point to distinguish that this presentation had different characteristics than measles.[44] It was redescribed by Johann Weyer during an epidemic in lower Germany between 1564 and 1565; he referred to it as scalatina anginosa. The first unequivocal description of scarlet fever appeared in a book by Joannes Coyttarus of Poitiers, De febre purpura epidemiale et contagiosa libri duo, which was published in 1578 in Paris. Daniel Sennert of Wittenberg described the classical 'scarlatinal desquamation' in 1572 and was also the first to describe the early arthritis, scarlatinal dropsy, and ascites associated with the disease.",
            "Andreas Vesalius\nSoon after publication, Vesalius was invited to become imperial physician to the court of Emperor Charles V. He informed the Venetian Senate that he would leave his post in Padua, which prompted Duke Cosimo I de' Medici to invite him to move to the expanding university in Pisa, which he declined. Vesalius took up the offered position in the imperial court, where he had to deal with other physicians who mocked him for being a mere barber surgeon instead of an academic working on the respected basis of theory.",

Still of all the discoveries made in ancient Egypt, the most important discovery relating to ancient Egyptian knowledge of medicine is the Ebers Papyrus, named after its discoverer Georg Ebers. The Ebers Papyrus, conserved at the University of Leipzig, is considered one of the oldest treaties on medicine and the most important medical papyri. The text is dated to about 1550 BCE and measures 20 meters in length. The text includes recipes, a pharmacopoeia and descriptions of numerous diseases as well as cosmetic treatments. It mentions how to surgically treat crocodile bites and serious burns, recommending the drainage of pus-filled inflammation but warns against certain diseased skin.",

Both Hernandez and Ximenez fitted Aztec ethnomedicinal information into the European concepts of disease such as \"warm\", \"cold\", and \"moist\", but it is not clear that the Aztecs used these categories.[14] Juan de Esteyneffer's Florilegio medicinal de todas las enfermedas compiled European texts and added 35 Mexican plants.",
            "Massage\nOne of the greatest Persian medics was Avicenna, also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980AD to 1037AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematisation of the fragmentary and unorganised Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, Al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b a\u1e6d-\u1e6cibb (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West.

During the Black Death he clearly distinguished Bubonic Plague and Pneumonic Plague as separate diseases, that they were contagious from person to person, and offered advice such as quarantine to avoid their spread in the population. He also served as the personal physician for three successive popes of the Avignon Papacy.",
            "Andreas Vesalius\nIn 1539 he also published his Venesection letter on bloodletting. This was a popular treatment for almost any illness, but there was some debate about where to take the blood from. The classical Greek procedure, advocated by Galen, was to collect blood from a site near the location of the illness. However, the Muslim and medieval practice was to draw a smaller amount of blood from a distant location. Vesalius' pamphlet generally supported Galen's view, but with qualifications that rejected the infiltration of Galen.",

He is remembered in the Western history of medicine as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European Renaissance. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle's position to take into account post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge.[104] Aristotle's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna's linking of Galen's medical writings with Aristotle's philosophical writings in the Canon of Medicine (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the Canon was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, princeps medicorum (\"prince of physicians\").[105]",
            "History of medicine\nAnother of Hippocrates's major contributions may be found in his descriptions of the symptomatology, physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of thoracic empyema, i.e. suppuration of the lining of the chest cavity.

            "History of botany\nMeanwhile, the study of medicinal plants was not being neglected and a full synthesis of ancient Greek pharmacology was compiled in Materia Medica c. 60 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides (c. 40-90 AD) who was a Greek physician with the Roman army. This work proved to be the definitive text on medicinal herbs, both oriental and occidental, for fifteen hundred years until the dawn of the European Renaissance being slavishly copied again and again throughout this period.[24] Though rich in medicinal information with descriptions of about 600 medicinal herbs, the botanical content of the work was extremely limited.[25]",
            "Humorism\nCentral to the treatment of unbalanced humors was the use of herbs. Specific herbs were used to treat all ailments simple, common and complex etc., from an uncomplicated upper respiratory infection to the plague. For example, chamomile was used to decrease heat, and lower excessive bile humor. Also, arsenic was used in a poultice bag to 'draw out' the excess humor(s) that led to symptoms of the plague. Philip Moore, who wrote on the hope of health, and Edwards, who wrote Treatise concerning the Plague discuss how these herbs are helpful in curing physical disease. They also discuss the importance of maintaining an herb garden.",

            "Science and technology of the Han dynasty\nIn his Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber (Jinkui yaolue), Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150\u00a0\u2013 c. 219 CE) was the first to suggest a regulated diet rich in certain vitamins could prevent different types of disease, an idea which led Hu Sihui (fl. 1314\u20131330 CE) to prescribe a diet rich in Vitamin B1 as a treatment for beriberi.[180] Zhang's major work was the Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shanghan zabing lun).[181] His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the Huangdi neijing and became knowledgeable in Chinese herbology.[182] Hua Tuo used anesthesia on patients during surgery and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month.[182] In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead fetus within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments.[182]",
            "Vein\nMichael Servetus was the first European to describe the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. He firstly described it in the \"Manuscript of Paris\"[12][13] (near 1546), but this work was never published. And later he published this description, but in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. Only three copies of the book survived but these remained hidden for decades, the rest were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.",
            "Muslim world\nMuslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of anatomy and physiology: such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, nervous and circulatory systems; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation. Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as Abulcasis) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif (\"Book of Concessions\"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries. Other medical advancements came in the fields of pharmacology and pharmacy.[76]",
            "Medicine in the medieval Islamic world\nThe early islamic physicians were familiar with the life of Hippocrates, and were aware of the fact that his biography was in part a legend. Also they knew that several persons lived who were called Hippocrates, and their works were compiled under one single name: Ibn an-Nad\u012bm has conveyed a short treatise by Tabit ben-Qurra on al-Buqratun (\"the (various persons called) Hippokrates\"). Translations of some of Hippocrates's works must have existed before Hunayn ibn Ishaq started his translations, because the historian Al-Ya\u02beq\u016bb\u012b compiled a list of the works known to him in 872. Fortunately, his list also supplies a summary of the content, quotations, or even the entire text of the single works. The philosopher Al-Kindi wrote a book with the title at-Tibb al-Buqrati (The Medicine of Hippocrates), and his contemporary Hunayn ibn Ish\u0101q then translated Galens commentary on Hippocrates. Rhazes is the first Arabic-writing physician who makes thorough use of Hippocrates's writings in order to set up his own medical system. Al-Tabari maintained that his compilation of hippocratic teachings (al-Mu\u02be\u0101la\u1e21\u0101t al-buqr\u0101\u1e6d\u012bya) was a more appropriate summary. The work of Hippocrates was cited and commented on during the entire period of medieval islamic medicine.[17]",
            "Botany\nPhysician Valerius Cordus (1515\u20131544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal Historia Plantarum in 1544 and a pharmacopoeia of lasting importance, the Dispensatorium in 1546.[20] Naturalist Conrad von Gesner (1516\u20131565) and herbalist John Gerard (1545\u2013c. 1611) published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522\u20131605) was considered the father of natural history, which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, Polymath Robert Hooke discovered cells, a term he coined, in cork, and a short time later in living plant tissue.[21]",
            "Etymology of chemistry\nDuring the later sixteenth century Agricola's new coinage slowly propagated. It seems to have been adopted in most of the vernacular European languages following Conrad Gessner's adoption of it in his extremely popular pseudonymous work, Thesaurus Euonymi Philiatri De remediis secretis: Liber physicus, medicus, et partim etiam chymicus (Zurich 1552). Gessner's work was frequently re-published in the second half of the 16th century in Latin and was also published in a number of vernacular European languages, with the word spelled without the al-.[10]",
            "Islamic world contributions to Medieval Europe\nOne of the most important medical works to be translated was Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine (1025), which was translated into Latin and then disseminated in manuscript and printed form throughout Europe. It remained a standard medical textbook in Europe until the early modern period, and during the 15th and 16th centuries alone, The Canon of Medicine was published more than thirty-five times.[49] Avicenna noted the contagious nature of some infectious diseases (which he attributed to \"traces\" left in the air by a sick person), and discussed how to effectively test new medicines.[50] He also wrote The Book of Healing, a more general encyclopedia of science and philosophy, which became another popular textbook in Europe. Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi) wrote the Comprehensive Book of Medicine, with its careful description of and distinction between measles and smallpox, which was also influential in Europe. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi wrote Kitab al-Tasrif, an encyclopedia of medicine which was particularly famed for its section on surgery. It included descriptions and diagrams of over 200 surgical instruments, many of which he developed. The surgery section was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century, and used in European medical schools for centuries, still being reprinted in the 1770s.[51][52]",

            "De humani corporis fabrica\nThe collection of books is based on his Paduan lectures, during which he deviated from common practice by dissecting a corpse to illustrate what he was discussing. Dissections had previously been performed by a barber surgeon under the direction of a doctor of medicine, who was not expected to perform manual labour. Vesalius's magnum opus presents a careful examination of the organs and the complete structure of the human body. This would not have been possible without the many advances that had been made during the Renaissance, including artistic developments in literal visual representation and the technical development of printing with refined woodcut engravings. Because of these developments and his careful, immediate involvement, Vesalius was able to produce illustrations superior to any produced previously.",
            "Medicine in the medieval Islamic world\nIbn Sina, more commonly known in west as Avicenna was a Persian polymath and physician of the tenth and eleventh centuries. He was known for his scientific works, but especially his writing on medicine.[57] He has been described as the \"Father of Early Modern Medicine\".[58] Ibn Sina is credited with many varied medical observations and discoveries, such as recognizing the potential of airborne transmission of disease, providing insight into many psychiatric conditions, recommending use of forceps in deliveries complicated by fetal distress, distinguishing central from peripheral facial paralysis and describing guinea worm infection and trigeminal neuralgia.[59] He is credited for writing two books in particular: his most famous, al-Canon fi al Tibb (The Canon of Medicine), and also The Book of Healing. His other works cover subjects including angelology, heart medicines, and treatment of kidney diseases.[57]",
            "Medicine in the medieval Islamic world\nMost likely, the Arabian physicians became familiar with the Graeco-Roman and late Hellenistic medicine through direct contact with physicians who were practicing in the newly conquered regions rather than by reading the original or translated works. The translation of the capital of the emerging Islamic world to Damascus may have facilitated this contact, as Syrian medicine was part of that ancient tradition. The names of two Christian physicians are known: Ibn A\u1e6f\u0101l worked at the court of Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty. The caliph abused his knowledge in order to get rid of some of his enemies by way of poisoning. Likewise, Abu l-\u1e24akam, who was responsible for the preparation of drugs, was employed by Muawiah. His son, grandson, and great-grandson were also serving the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphate.[11]",

His work was highly respected by the 10th/11th century physicians and scientists al-Biruni and al-Nadim, who recorded biographical information about al-Razi, and compiled lists of, and provided commentaries on, his writings.

Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.\" [17]",

The practice for cauterizing gunshot wounds on the battlefield had been to use boiling oil, an extremely dangerous and painful procedure. Par\u00e9 began to employ a less irritating emollient, made of egg yolk, rose oil and turpentine. He also described more efficient techniques for the effective ligation of the blood vessels during an amputation.",

Series creator Shonda Rhimes wanted a diverse cast, and so created characters without pre-specified races.[8] Determined not to have a show in which \"all the extras are white, except the lone janitor\", she has created what The New York Times has called \"one of the most colorful backgrounds in television\".[9] Rhimes used a \"blind-casting\" technique, which resulted in several roles going to actors of different racial backgrounds than first envisioned. Isaiah Washington, eventually cast as Preston Burke, was originally considered for the role of Derek Shepherd, while Burke was initially to be played by a white actor who dropped out at the last moment. Chandra Wilson was cast in the role of Miranda Bailey, who Rhimes had imagined as a blonde until auditioning Wilson. The Campus have observed that the Grey's Anatomy cast is actually more diverse than the city it emulates, noting that Seattle is actually 70% Caucasian.[10]",

After his last episode, How to Save a Life premiered, many fans were outraged with Shonda Rhimes for how the episode was written and vowed to never watch the show again. Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Of all the ways he could\u2019ve gone\u2014dying while saving that family in a shocking but heroic moment, or dying at Grey Sloan and getting a chance to say goodbye to everyone\u2014this felt cheap. And quite frankly, it felt a little rude to the man himself. He was called McDreamy for a reason, and he deserved better than this.\"[59] Citing the storylines of Derek's death, Callie and Arizona splitting up, and April and Jackson losing their baby, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Season 11 is one of the most depressing seasons of Grey's Anatomy.[60]",
            "Meredith Grey\nMaura O'Malley of Bustle also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying, \"When the series began, Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life. She had graduated medical school, she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital, and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached, one night stand. What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet \u2014 but the key is, she wasn't searching for love. Working and learning were \u2014 and continue to be \u2014 her priorities, while McDreamy was simply an added perk. Hopefully, the new season of Grey's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone, because Meredith is a strong, independent woman \u2014 and she will be just fine.\"[46]",

            "Super Bowl I\nHornung was the only Packer not to see any action. Lombardi had asked him in the fourth quarter if he wanted to go in, but Hornung declined, not wanting to aggravate a pinched nerve in his neck. McGee, who caught only four passes for 91 yards and one touchdown during the season, finished Super Bowl I with seven receptions for 138 yards and two touchdowns. After the game was over, a reporter asked Vince Lombardi about if he thought Kansas City was a good team. Lombardi responded that though the Chiefs were an excellent, well-coached club, he thought several NFL teams such as Dallas were better.[43]",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nThe Chiefs hit rock bottom in 2012, with a passing game that was one of the worst of all time. Cassel was benched twice in favor of Brady Quinn, but neither quarterback could get the job done. Despite having a roster that produced five Pro Bowlers and a 1,500-yard rushing season from Charles, the Chiefs stumbled to a 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 record. Romeo Crennel was fired one day after the conclusion of the season, and on January 4, 2013, the Chiefs parted ways with GM Scott Pioli and officially named Andy Reid as the next Chiefs head coach.",
            "Andy Reid\nUnder Reid, the Chiefs would again obtain a winning record in the 2014 season, finishing 9-7. However, they failed to qualify for the playoffs.",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nThe following year, with Elvis Grbac back at the helm, the Chiefs fell to 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9 in 1998. Marty Schottenheimer took much of the blame for his failed attempts in the playoffs and conservative style of coaching (\"Martyball\"), and resigned following the 1998 season.",
            "Andy Reid\nReid went on to lead the Chiefs to a 9-0 record at the start of the season, tied for the best start in franchise history. The Chiefs finished with an 11-5 record, clinching a Wild Card spot in the AFC playoffs. In the Wild Card round, they were defeated by the Indianapolis Colts 45\u00e2\u20ac\u201c44, despite holding a 28-point lead in the third quarter.[20]",
            "Super Bowl IV\nThe Chiefs still managed to clinch a playoff spot. Wanting to set itself up more like the NFL right before the merger, the AFL expanded the playoffs for the 1969 season, by having the second place teams from each division face the first place teams from the other division (Western Champion vs. Eastern Runner-Up, and vice versa). As a result of the new playoff format, many critics thought the Chiefs entered the playoffs through a \"back-door\" as the runner up in the Western division. However, Dawson silenced the critics and led Kansas City to a strong finish in the playoffs, defeating the defending champion Jets in New York, 13\u20136 in the Divisional Playoffs, and defeating the Raiders (who had beaten them 41-6 in the previous year's postseason) 17\u20137 in the AFL Championship Game, thus essentially making the Chiefs the first wild card team to play in the Super Bowl. (Dawson says he thinks both the Jets and the Raiders could have beaten the Vikings.)[7]",
            "Super Bowl IV\nMeanwhile, it seemed that the Chiefs, led by head coach Hank Stram, and especially quarterback Len Dawson, were jinxed throughout the year. In the second game of the regular season, Dawson suffered a knee injury that kept him from playing the next six games. However, back-up quarterback Mike Livingston of Southern Methodist University fame engineered five wins of the next six starts, with Dawson coming off the bench in the second half of the sixth to clinch the win. The Chiefs managed to finish in second place behind the Oakland Raiders in the AFL's Western Division, but only after suffering a tough 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 loss to Oakland in the final game of the regular season. After that game, many sports writers and fans heavily criticized the team and Dawson for the poor play calling (Dawson called between 80 and 90 percent of the plays during the season).[7]",
            "Herm Edwards\nThe Chiefs finished at 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7, edging out the Denver Broncos (who lost in OT to the San Francisco 49ers in the final game of the season) by divisional tiebreaker for second place in the AFC West, and making the playoffs as the sixth seed in the AFC. This was their first playoff appearance in the previous three seasons.[citation needed]",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nA tearful head coach Dick Vermeil announced his retirement before the final game of the 2005 season. Within two weeks, then-New York Jets head coach Herman Edwards had signed a new 4-year contract to coach the Chiefs. The 2006 Chiefs returned to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons, only to lose 23\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 in the Wild Card round against their playoff nemesis, the Indianapolis Colts.",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nThe Chiefs have also had a repeated history of backup quarterbacks that steal the spotlight.[13][14] Mike Livingston led the Chiefs to the playoffs in their 1969 season after starting quarterback Len Dawson was injured for the majority of the year. Most recently, Rich Gannon took over for the injured Elvis Grbac in the 1997 season, but was revoked of the job in favor of Grbac's return for the playoffs. The Chiefs lost in the playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos. A similar incident occurred in the 2006 season and playoffs when Trent Green and the Chiefs' offense failed to get a first down in the first forty-two minutes of the game. Backup quarterback Damon Huard, who led the Chiefs on a 5\u20132 record in Green's absence, never played a down in the playoff loss to\u2014coincidentally\u2014the eventual Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts.[13][14][15]",
            "Herm Edwards\nIn the 2007 season, the Chiefs were plagued with quarterback, running back, kicker and offensive coaching controversies. Damon Huard started the season and compiled a 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 record. He was benched in favor of Edwards' 2006 draft choice Brodie Croyle, who split time with Huard mid-season, was injured, then finished most of the season. Croyle played in a total of nine games and did not win any. Running back Larry Johnson injured his foot mid-season and was replaced by Priest Holmes who came out of retirement late in the year and was ineffective.[citation needed]",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nHunt, with a roster replete with players who had played college football in Texas, wanted to maintain a lineage to the team's roots and wanted to name the club the Kansas City Texans.[2] \"The Lakers stayed the Lakers when they moved from Minnesota to California\", he reasoned. \"But Jack Steadman convinced me that wasn\u2019t too smart. It wouldn\u2019t sell.\" The team was renamed the Kansas City Chiefs\u2014one of the most popular suggestions Hunt received in a name-the-team contest. [5] Lamar Hunt sent letters dated June 21, 1963 to all the contest entrants who selected the name CHIEFS in the \"Rename the Texans\" contest of whom Mrs. Joan Feuerborn was one of those entrants, and along with their respective guesses as to the number of season tickets sold by May 1st. The actual total was 10,808, and based on this the car winner was Mr. E. L. Diemler of Kansas City, Missouri. Another name also considered at the time for the team was the Kansas City Mules.[5]",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nIn the 2008 season opener at New England, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was hit in the leg by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard, tearing his ACL and removing him from action for the rest of the year. Other than that, there was little else of note about the season, which saw Kansas City fall to a franchise-worst 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 record.",
            "Andy Reid\nIn 2016, the Chiefs started 2-2 and were blown out on Sunday Night Football against the Pittsburgh Steelers 43-14 in Week 4. After an early Week 5 bye, Andy Reid and the Chiefs went on a 5-game winning streak culminating in a win over the former NFC champion Carolina Panthers. They went 5-2 over the last 7 games of their season, but with an Oakland loss and a Kansas City win on the final day of the season, the Chiefs finished the season with a 12-4 record and clinched the AFC West title for the first time since 2010. Doing so also guaranteed them a first-round bye. On January 15, the Chiefs lost in the AFC Divisional Round to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 18-16. During the game, Steelers kicker Chris Boswell broke a Steelers playoff franchise record with 6 field goals. With 9:49 on the click in the fourth quarter, quarterback Alex Smith completed a short pass to Travis Kelce, which turned into a 24 yard gain. Then, running back Spencer Ware rushed for 11 yards. Then Smith took a deep shot for Maclin but it was incomplete. A face mask by the Chiefs drove them 15 yards farther from the end zone, or even a chance at a Cairo Santos field goal. With a 2nd and 25 Smith threw a completed fade to tight end Travis Kelce for a 17 yard pickup. On 3rd and 8, Smith threw it incomplete, but on 4th, they picked up the first down with a Smith to Chris Conley connection. Smith drove the Chiefs to the end zone to make the score 18-16 steelers ahead. But, a 10 yard penalty was called on Kansas City which pushed them back for the PAT. With the 2 minute warning approaching, the Chiefs had to go for 2. They failed to convert from the 12 yard line with an incompletion to Maclin. The Steelers ran the ball the rest of the game and moved on to challenge the Patriots for the AFC Title without scoring a single touchdown.",
            "Patrick Mahomes\nThe Chiefs announced on December 27, 2017, that with a playoff spot and the fourth seed in the playoffs secured, they would rest starter Alex Smith and give Mahomes his first career start in their Week 17 game against the Denver Broncos.[45] Mahomes played most of the game and helped lead the Chiefs to a 27\u00e2\u20ac\u201c24 win, and completed 22 of 35 passes for 284 yards with an interception.[46]",
            "Kansas City Chiefs\nIn 2014, the Chiefs attempted to make the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1995, however they finished 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 and were eliminated in Week 17.",
            "Herm Edwards\nOn January 6, 2007, the Chiefs were soundly defeated by the Indianapolis Colts 23\u20138. In the first half, the Chiefs offense failed to produce a single first down. This was the first time in the modern NFL era (post AFL\u2013NFL merger), and the first time since 1960, that any team had been held without a first down in the first half of a playoff game.[12]",
            "Ryan Succop\nAt the end of the 2011 season, Succop signed a five-year contract extension worth $14 million, which includes $2 million in guaranteed salary and $675,000 in incentives if Succop makes a Pro Bowl and the Chiefs make the playoffs every season of his contract.[22]",
            "Andy Reid\nIn 2015, the Chiefs were in danger of missing the playoffs for a second consecutive year after they lost five straight games and began the season 1-5. Reid accepted the blame for his team's poor start[21] and his future with the Chiefs was called into question.[22] However, the Chiefs rebounded and proceeded to win every remaining regular season game, finishing with an 11-5 record and a Wild Card spot in the AFC playoffs. Reid would go on to lead the Chiefs to their first playoff win since 1994 in a 30-0 shutout of the Houston Texans, but the team would be defeated 27-20 in their subsequent Divisional Round game against the New England Patriots. Prior to the loss, the Chiefs posted an eleven-game winning streak, which is the best in franchise history. Reid was criticized for his clock management near the end of game, calling no timeouts in a late fourth quarter drive that cut the Patriots' 27-13 lead down to a touchdown, but took the Chiefs 5 minutes and 16 seconds to score and left them with only a minute and 13 seconds on the clock to tie the game.[23]",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nA longtime nemesis with Seattle, \"Plan B\" free agent quarterback Dave Krieg was signed as the club's starter on March 19. A melancholy off-season awaited the Chiefs, who mourned the passing of Player Personnel Director Whitey Dovell on May 22 and Hall of Fame defensive tackle Buck Buchanan on July 16. Both Dovell and Buchanan lost courageous battles with cancer. Six-time Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry announced his retirement in July after registering 50 interceptions in 11 seasons with the franchise. The Chiefs retired the jerseys of former players Buck Buchanan (#86), Willie Lanier (#63) and Jan Stenerud (#3) in a ceremony prior to a pre-season contest against Buffalo.[8]",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nFor their 2005 campaign, the Chiefs brought in several new players to boost a defense that had finished among the worst units the past three years. The year also saw Larry Johnson start at running back in place of an injured Priest Holmes. But despite winning ten games, the Chiefs became just the fourth team in NFL history to go 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 and not reach the playoffs.",
            "Kansas City Chiefs\nIn the Wild Card round the Chiefs lost a tight game to the Tennessee Titans 22-21, allowing Derrick Henry to rush for 156 yards. That ended another disappointing season for the Chiefs, and extended their NFL record for most consecutive home playoff losses to six. [71]",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nTo begin 1983, the Chiefs fired head coach Marv Levy on January 4 after compiling a 31\u00e2\u20ac\u201c42 record. Dallas Cowboys quarterbacks coach John Mackovic was named the fifth head coach in team history on February 2. The 39-year-old Mackovic became the youngest individual ever to hold that post for the club.[7] The Chiefs held the seventh overall pick in the quarterback-laden 1983 NFL Draft and selected Todd Blackledge. The five other signal-callers selected in the first round that year included John Elway, Jim Kelly, Tony Eason, Ken O'Brien and Dan Marino.",
            "Logos and uniforms of the Kansas City Chiefs\nThe white jersey\u00e2\u20ac\u201cred pants combination was not used between 1989 and 1999, primarily during the period when Marty Schottenheimer was the team's head coach. In 2006, under new head coach Herman Edwards, the Chiefs wore white uniforms with white pants at home against the Cincinnati Bengals.",
            "Matt Cassel\nOn December 8, 2010, Cassel underwent an emergency appendectomy. It was unclear at the time whether he would be able to play in that week's game against the San Diego Chargers.[63] The Chiefs ended up starting backup Brodie Croyle and lost the game 31\u20130. Cassel returned for the next two games however and led the Chiefs to landslide wins over both the St. Louis Rams in the Governors Cup and then at home against the Tennessee Titans. The 34\u201314 win over the Titans, along with a loss by the Chargers to the Bengals, helped the Chiefs clinch the division title.[64] This would be the first Chiefs playoff game in four years and the first home playoff game since 2003, the last time the Chiefs won the AFC West division.[64] In a home playoff 30-7 loss against the Baltimore Ravens, Cassel went 9 of 18 for 70 yards passing, zero touchdown passes, and three interceptions.[65]",
            "Kansas City Chiefs\nAt the end of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before home games, many Chiefs fans intentionally yell out \"CHIEFS!\" rather than singing \"brave\" as the final word.[127] In 1996, general manager Carl Peterson said \"We all look forward, not only at Arrowhead, but on the road, too, to when we get to that stanza of the National Anthem... Our players love it.\"[127] After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Chiefs fans refrained from doing so in honor of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and continued to do so for the remainder of the 2001 season.[128] At the Chiefs' September 23, 2001, home game against the New York Giants, fans gave the opposing Giants a standing ovation.[79]",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nVermeil brought many elements of \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" from St. Louis to Kansas City's own offense, but much like the Schottenheimer era in the 1990s, the offense didn't win any playoff games.",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nOne of the few remaining bright spots in a disappointing 6\u201310 season came in the regular season finale against San Diego when wide receiver Stephone Paige set an NFL record with 309 receiving yards in a 38\u201334 win, breaking the previous mark of 303 yards set by Cleveland's Jim Benton in 1945. Paige's mark was subsequently surpassed by a 336-yard effort by Flipper Anderson (L.A. Rams) in 1989.[7]",
            "2010\u201311 NFL playoffs\nBaltimore dominated the game on both sides of the ball, massively out-gaining Kansas City in total yards (390 to 161), first downs (26 to 8), and time of possession (44:44 to 18:16). The Chiefs, who only lost 14 turnovers all year, turned the ball over five times and went home with their seventh consecutive playoff loss since the 1993 season. Their losing streak has covered 17 years, four different coaches, and two different owners.",
            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nAfter a strong 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 start, the Chiefs' offensive woes slowed the team down.

            "History of the Kansas City Chiefs\nFollowing their championship win, the NFL-AFL merger placed the Chiefs in the newly created AFC West division with the Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos. The team traded running back Mike Garrett to San Diego in 1970 and replaced him in the lineup with Ed Podolak. Despite a 44\u201324 win against Baltimore on September 28 in just the second-ever telecast of ABC's Monday Night Football package, the Chiefs owned a 3\u20133\u20131 record at the season's midpoint. The Chiefs and the Raiders tied a game at 17\u201317 on November 1 following a controversial play from Oakland. The Chiefs were ahead 17\u201314 when Len Dawson apparently sealed the win, running for a first down which would have allowed Kansas City to run out the clock. While on the ground, Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end Ben Davidson in an infamous incident that cost the Chiefs a victory and further inflamed the already heated Chiefs-Raiders rivalry.[6] Wide receiver Otis Taylor retaliated and a bench-clearing brawl ensued. Offsetting penalties were called, nullifying Dawson's first down. The Chiefs were forced to punt and Raiders kicker George Blanda booted a game-tying field goal with eight seconds remaining. That tie ultimately cost the Chiefs the opportunity to split the AFC West division title with Oakland as Kansas City finished the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record, while the Raiders went 8\u20134\u20132 and reached the conference championship.[6]",

Perhaps most recognizable is Arnett's voice saying, \"It's not more than you need, just more than you're used to\" in ads for GMC trucks.[34] He has also lent his voice to a number of television shows, such as Ghostwriter in the 2005 Nickelodeon's hit series Danny Phantom, Duncan Schiesst for the Comedy Central animated program Freak Show, which was created by and also stars the voice of his Arrested Development co-star, David Cross. Arnett was the announcer for the faux trailer \"Don't\" in the 2007 film Grindhouse. He has also voiced characters in animated films, including Vlad in Horton Hears a Who!,[35] The Missing Link in Monsters vs. Aliens, Horst the German sous-chef in Ratatouille and Mr. Perkins in Despicable Me. He planned to be the voice of the K.I.T.T. in Universal's Knight Rider, a sequel to the popular 1980s television series. The production featured a Ford Mustang as K.I.T.T. Since Arnett had a previous long standing relationship with competitor automaker General Motors as the voice for GMC Trucks commercials, GM asked Arnett to pull out of the project. Arnett opted to withdraw from the project and he was replaced by Val Kilmer.[36] Arnett made a commercial cameo for the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.[37]",

            "History of alcoholic drinks\nAlmost every important town from Massachusetts to the Carolinas had a rum distillery to meet the local demand, which had increased dramatically. Rum was often enjoyed in mixed drinks, including flip. This was a popular winter beverage made of rum and beer sweetened with sugar and warmed by plunging a red-hot fireplace poker into the serving mug.\nAlcohol was viewed positively while its abuse was condemned. Increase Mather (d. 1723) expressed the common view in a sermon against drunkenness: \"Drink is in itself a good creature of God, and to be received with thankfulness, but the abuse of drink is from Satan; the wine is from God, but the drunkard is from the Devil.\"",

The elderly Uchendu, attempting to shake Okonkwo out of his self-pity, refers to a song sung after the death of a woman: \"For whom is it well, for whom is it well? There is no one for whom it is well.\"[160] This song contrasts with the \"gay and rollicking tunes of evangelism\" sung later by the white missionaries.[161]",

            "United States presidential election, 2008\nSimilar to Senator Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, one of the more widely leveled charges against McCain was the issue of his age\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe turned 72 in August and there was widespread concern about the idea of electing a man who would be 80 years old if he completed two full terms in office (the oldest president, Ronald Reagan, had been a month shy of 78 when he left office in January 1989). In addition, McCain suffered from the ill effects of his captivity in North Vietnam and reportedly had difficulty lifting his arms above his head. His age in particular was considered a liability against the youthful Senator Obama, who was the first Generation Xer to run for president on a major party ticket. McCain for comparison was born before World War II and belonged to the generation preceding the baby boomers. Much like Bob Dole, McCain attempted to counter these charges by releasing all of his medical records, something Obama did not do. McCain's wife Cindy dismissed concerns about his health by arguing that \"We went hiking the Grand Canyon last summer and [John] did great and had no trouble keeping up with us.\" McCain also appeared at several campaign stops with his still-active 95-year-old mother. In a speech on the House floor, Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha criticized McCain's age by saying \"Seven presidents have come and gone since I've been in Congress, and I saw the toll the job took on each one of them.\" If elected, McCain would have been the first, and only, President born in the decade of the 1930s.",

            "William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign, 1896\nIn September, the Gold Democrats met in convention in Indianapolis. Loyal to Cleveland, they wanted to nominate him. However, the President ruled this out; his Cabinet members also refused to run. Not even supporters thought the Gold Democrats would win; the purpose was to have a candidate who would speak for the gold element in the party, and who would divide the vote and defeat Bryan. Illinois Senator John M. Palmer was eager to be the presidential candidate, and the convention nominated him with Kentucky's Simon Bolivar Buckner as his running mate. Palmer was a 79-year-old former Union general, Buckner a 73-year-old former Confederate of that rank; the ticket was the oldest in combined age in American history, and Palmer the second-oldest presidential candidate (behind Peter Cooper of the Greenback Party; Bryan was the youngest). The Gold Democrats received quiet financial support from Hanna and the Republicans. Palmer proved an able campaigner who visited most major cities in the East, and in the final week of his campaign, told listeners, \"I will not count it any great fault if next Tuesday you decide to cast your ballots for William McKinley.\"[131]",

His death meant that for the first time since 1933, when Calvin Coolidge died during Herbert Hoover's final months in office, that there were no former Presidents still living; Johnson had been the only living ex-President since December 26, 1972, following the death of Harry S.

            "Evil Queen (Disney)\nThe Queen's character design from the film was also used in some other Snow White adaptations, such as for the Queen in the Turkish film Pamuk Prenses ve Yedi C\u00c3\u00bcceler (1970).[314] Queen Naga in Italian erotic comic books Biancaneve was at first loosely based on the Disney version, as was its Snow White's character.[315][316] Susan Sarandon's character of Queen Narissa in Disney's own Enchanted (2007), had her characteristics, powers, and physical features were inspired by the Queen from the film and by Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty.[317] Early on into the project, Enchanted was actually supposed to be a direct-to-video animated sequel to Disney's Snow White (with a working title of \"Snow White 2\") in which Narissa (back then often misspelled as \"Noriss\") was the evil Queen's sister who would kidnap six of the dwarfs to lure Snow White, the Prince, and their 13-year-old daughter Rose aided by Dopey, into a trap.[318] When Filmation announced their own animated sequel to the fairy tale, the studio was sued by Disney until Filmation promised their characters would not resemble the ones from the Disney film; the settlement stated there could not be a \"wicked witch\" character in the film which instead was made to feature the Queen's brother in a vendetta to avenge her death (the title was also changed, from Snow White in the Land of Doom to Happily Ever After).[319][320]",

            "Ursula (Disney)\nUrsula has earned a positive reception from entertainment critics. When The Little Mermaid was first released in 1989, film critics and audiences alike immediately embraced Ursula as one of Disney's best villains,[18] as well as one of the studio's strongest and most powerful villains in several years.[53][73] Film critic Roger Ebert dubbed Ursula Disney's \"most satisfying villainess since\" Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' Evil Queen, who debuted in 1937.[74] Critics agree that Ursula played an important role in the overall success of The Little Mermaid.[75] Samantha Rullo of Bustle reviewed Ursula as a \"way more interesting\" character than Ariel herself, while praising her for \"rocking the best hair and makeup of any Disney villain.\"[76] Also writing for Bustle, Caitlyn Callegari appreciated Ursula for \"tell[ing] it like it is.\"[77] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel hailed Ursula as \"A total success\" despite sharing some similarities with previous Disney villains.[56] Janet Maslin of The New York Times described Ursula as \"a fabulously campy creation embodying the film's well-developed sense of mischief.\"[78] Describing the character as an \"inventive high-camp villainess,\" the New York Daily News' Kathleen Carroll cited Ursula as a prime example of the film's \"outstanding\" animation.[79] Hailing the character as \"a visual feast,\" Variety considered Ursula to be among \"the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more inspired inventions\".[80]",
            "Evil Queen (Disney)\nThe Queen's appearance was inspired by the \"ageless ice goddess\"[19] character of Queen Ayesha (\"She who must be obeyed\") from the 1935 film She, played by Helen Gahagan.[20][21] The Queen was originally to be named Grimhilde[10] (but who is never actually named in the film[22]), was also modeled in part on Princess Kriemhild in the 1924 film Die Nibelungen.[23] It is also possible that the Queen's looks may have been inspired by the faces of Joan Crawford[24] and Gale Sondergaard;[25] her costume and figure may have been inspired by a column statue at the Naumburg Cathedral depicting Uta von Ballenstedt, the wife of Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen who was widely regarded as the most beautiful woman of Medieval Germany.[26][27] Also noted was her resemblance to two 1930s American movie stars from Europe, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich.[28] The Queen and Snow White were refined by Grim Natwick and Norm Ferguson, who would often override Walt Disney's instructions.[29] As in the case of other characters for the film, the Queen's appearance had to be approved by Albert Hurter before being finalised.[14] One pre-final version of the queen had her wear a looser hood and a different crown and the edge of her cape was fur trimmed, as it can be seen in Gustaf Tenggren's pictures.[30][31]",
            "Evil Queen (Disney)\nThe Queen inspired main antagonist characters in the otherwise unrelated titles, such as the stepmother queen in the Russian animated film The Wild Swans (1962),[299] the Witch Queen in the Spanish film Tom Thumb and Little Red Riding Hood (1962),[300] the goddess Venus in the anime version of Unico,[301] Queen Admira in the American film The Hugga Bunch (1985),[302] and the queen of the witches in the video game Curse of Enchantia (1992).[303] Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles' 1948 Macbeth resembles the Queen in her costume, make-up, and even the manner of her death;[304] Lady Macbeth was also visually based on the Queen in a 1982 comic book adaptation.[305] The evil Queen Bavmorda from 1988's film Willow bears a resemblance too,[306] so much that Cinefantastique editor Frederick S. Clarke described her as \"simply Snow White's Wicked Queen, right down to her hooded costume.\"[307] Robin Wood has drawn a connection between the looks of the Witch and of the Emperor in the Star Wars franchise (which eventually also became a Disney property).[308] According to the designer Steve Brown, the Queen's old Witch form served as an inspiration for the main character Witch Queen in his 1985 video game Cauldron.[309] Brigitte Nielsen said she has also based her role as the Black Witch (who also kidnaps a prince character out of jealously for a princess) in the 1992 Italian film Fantaghir\u00f2 2 on Disney's \"Grimilde\" (an Italian name for the Queen in the comics).[310]",

            "The Little Mermaid (1989 film)\nThe design of the villainous Ursula was based upon drag performer Divine.[14] An additional early inspiration before Divine was Joan Collins in her role as Alexis Carrington in the television show Dynasty, due to a suggestion from Howard Ashman, who was a fan of the series.[23] Pat Carroll was not Clements and Musker's first choice to voice Ursula; the original script had been written with Bea Arthur of the Disney-owned TV series The Golden Girls in mind. After Arthur turned the part down, actresses such as Nancy Marchand, Nancy Wilson, Roseanne, Charlotte Rae, and Elaine Stritch were considered for the part.[24] Stritch was eventually cast as Ursula, but clashed with Howard Ashman's style of music production and was replaced by Carroll.[24] Various actors auditioned for additional roles in the film, including Jim Carrey for the role of Prince Eric, and comedians Bill Maher and Michael Richards for the role of Scuttle.[23]",

The grandmother explains that humans have a much shorter lifespan than a mermaid's 300 years, but that when mermaids die, they turn to sea foam and cease to exist, while humans have an eternal soul that lives on in heaven. The Little Mermaid, longing for the prince and an eternal soul, visits the Sea Witch in a dangerous part of the ocean. The witch willingly helps her by selling her a potion that gives her legs in exchange for her tongue and beautiful voice, as the Little Mermaid has the most enchanting voice in the world. The witch warns the Little Mermaid that once she becomes a human, she will never be able to return to the sea. Consuming the potion will make her feel as if a sword is being passed through her body, yet when she recovers, she will have two human legs and will be able to dance like no human has ever danced before. However, she will constantly feel as if she is walking on sharp knives, and her feet will bleed terribly. In addition, she will obtain a soul only if she wins the love of the prince and marries him, for then a part of his soul will flow into her. Otherwise, at dawn on the first day after he marries someone else, the Little Mermaid will die with a broken heart and dissolve into sea foam upon the waves.",

            "Northwest Territory\nIn March 1791, St. Clair succeeded Harmar as commander of the United States Army and was commissioned as a major general. He personally led a punitive expedition involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. In October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign, Fort Jefferson (Ohio) was built under the direction of General Arthur St. Clair. Located in present-day Darke County in far western Ohio, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named Fort Deposit. One month later, near modern-day Fort Recovery, his force advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the Wabash River, but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by Miami Chief Little Turtle and Shawnee chief Blue Jacket. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, which has since borne the name \"St. Clair's Defeat\", also known as the \"Battle of the Wabash\", the \"Columbia Massacre,\" or the \"Battle of a Thousand Slain\". It remains the greatest defeat of a US Army by Native Americans in history, with about 623 American soldiers killed in action and about 50 Native American killed. Although an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission in March 1792 at the request of President Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.[9][10][11]",
            "St. Charles, Missouri\nBlanchette settled there in about 1769 under the authority of the Spanish governor of Upper Louisiana (the area had been ceded by France to Spain under an agreement with Great Britain following French defeat in the French and Indian Wars). He was appointed as the territory's civil and military leader, serving until his death in 1793. Although the settlement was under Spanish jurisdiction, the settlers were primarily Native American and French Canadians who had migrated from northern territories.",
            "Northwest Indian War\nHe instructed General John Sullivan to attack and destroy Six Nations villages in upper New York. Leading about 5,000 troops, Sullivan defeated the Six Nations forces in the Battle of Newtown, then destroyed over 40 Six Nations villages and all their stored crops in the fall of 1779. Because of the social disruption and crop losses, some Six Nations men, women, and children died of starvation that winter. Many Six Nations families retreated to Fort Niagara and other parts of Canada, where they spent a cold and hungry winter. Their power in the present-day United States territory was lessened, and their claim to the Northwest Territories was challenged.",
            "Israel Putnam\nHe had previously served notably as an officer with Rogers' Rangers during the French and Indian War, when he was captured by Mohawk warriors. He was saved from the ritual burning given to enemies by intervention of a French officer, with whom the Mohawk were allied.",

            "West Virginia\nChristopher Gist, a surveyor in the employ of the first Ohio Company, which was composed chiefly of Virginians, explored the country along the Ohio River north of the mouth of the Kanawha River between 1751 and 1752. The company sought to have a fourteenth colony established with the name \"Vandalia\". Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750, though they were hindered by Native American resistance. Few Native Americans lived permanently within the present limits of the state, but the region was a common hunting ground, crossed by many trails. During the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe), Indian allies of the French nearly destroyed the scattered British settlements.",
            "Colonial American military history\nBritish defenders at Fort William Henry (at the southern end of Lake George) were surrounded by an overwhelming French force and their Indian allies from many tribes in August 1757. The British surrendered to the French after being offered terms that included protection from the Indians. Nonetheless, the Indian warriors' customs permitted the enslavement of some captured enemy soldiers and the scalping of others, and they ignored French efforts to prevent the massacre. They killed or captured hundreds of the surrendered British force, including women, children, servants, and slaves. Some of those scalped had smallpox, and the scalps were brought to numerous Indian villages as trophies, where they caused an epidemic that killed thousands of Indians.",
            "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall\nCamilla's French lineage derives partially through her maternal great-great-grandmother, Sophia Mary MacNab of Hamilton, Ontario, daughter of Sir Allan MacNab, who was the Prime Minister of the Province of Canada before Confederation.[239] Sophia was the wife of William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle and their son was  The Hon. George Keppel (maternal great-grandfather of Camilla). Through Sophia, Camilla is descended from 17th-century French colonists Zacharie Cloutier and Jean Guyon, who founded some of the principal families of Quebec City.[8][234] She is also descended from several American Loyalists through Sophia such as  Ephraim Jones, born in Massachusetts in 1750, who fought with the British during the American Revolution, was captured at the Battle of Saratoga, and later settled in Upper Canada. His daughter Sophia married John Stuart Jr. (born 1777, New York), the son of Rev John Stuart, who was born in Pennsylvania in 1740 and was chaplain for the 2nd Battalion of the King's Royal Regiment of New York.[240]",
            "Joseph Warren\nWarren had been commissioned a Major General in the colony's militia shortly before the June 17, 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. Rather than exercising his rank, Warren served in the battle as a private soldier, and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the redoubt atop Breed's Hill. His death, immortalized in John Trumbull's painting, The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775, galvanized the rebel forces. He has been memorialized in the naming of many towns, counties and other locations in the United States, by statues, and in numerous other ways.",
            "Fort Niagara\nFrench and Indian War",
            "History of Pennsylvania\nThe western portions of Pennsylvania were among disputed territory between the colonial British and French during the French and Indian War (the North American component of the Seven Years' War). The French had established numerous fortified sites in Pennsylvania, including Fort Le Boeuf, Fort Presque Isle, Fort Machault, and the pivotal Fort Duquesne, located near the present site of Pittsburgh. Many Indian tribes were allied with the French because of their long trading history and opposition to the expansion of the British colonies. The conflict began near the present site of Uniontown, Pennsylvania when a company of Virginia militia under the command of George Washington ambushed a French force at the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754. Washington retreated to Fort Necessity and surrendered to a larger French force at the Battle of Fort Necessity. In 1755, the British sent Braddock Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne, but the expedition ended in failure after the British lost the Battle of the Monongahela near present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania. In 1758, the British sent the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. The French won the Battle of Fort Duquesne, but after the battle the outnumbered French force demolished Fort Duquesne and retreated from the area. Fighting in North America had mostly come to an end by 1760, but the war continued until the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Britain's victory in the war helped secure Pennsylvania's frontier, as the Ohio Country came under formal British control. Though New France was no more, the French would deal their British rivals a major blow in the American Revolution by aiding the rebel cause.",
            "Yonkers, New York\nNear the site of van der Donck's mill is Philipse Manor Hall, a Colonial-era manor house which today serves as a museum and archive, offering many glimpses into life before the American Revolution. The original structure (later enlarged) was built around 1682 by Frederick Philipse and his wife Margaret Hardenbroeck. Frederick was a wealthy Dutchman who by the time of his death had amassed an enormous estate, which encompassed the entire modern City of Yonkers, as well as several other Hudson River towns. Philipse's great-grandson, Frederick Philipse III, was a prominent Loyalist during the American Revolution, who, because of his political leanings, was forced to flee to England. All the lands that belonged to the Philipse family were confiscated and sold.",
            "Upstate New York\nTo counter the French militarily, the British established forts along Lake Ontario and at portages between the Mohawk Valley and the adjacent Lake Champlain and Lake Ontario watersheds. The region became the area for many conflicts of the French and Indian War, such as the Battle of Fort Oswego (1756) and the Siege of Fort William Henry (which was later depicted in the work of James Fenimore Cooper), during the Seven Years' War.",
            "Continental Army\nHowever the United States military realized it needed a well-trained standing army following St. Clair's Defeat on November 4, 1791, when a force led by General Arthur St. Clair was almost entirely wiped out by the Western Confederacy near Fort Recovery, Ohio. The plans, which were supported by U.S. President George Washington and Henry Knox, Secretary of War, led to the disbandment of the Continental Army and the creation of the Legion of the United States. The command would be based on the 18th-century military works of Henry Bouquet, a professional Swiss soldier who served as a colonel in the British army, and French Marshal Maurice de Saxe. In 1792 Anthony Wayne, a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War, was encouraged to leave retirement and return to active service as Commander-in-Chief of the Legion with the rank of Major General.",
            "Coosa River\nIn the early 18th century, almost all European and Indian trade in the southeast ceased during the tribal uprisings brought on by the Yamasee War against the Carolinas. After a few years, the Indian trade system was resumed under somewhat reformed policies. The conflict between the French and English over the Coosa Valley, and much of the southeast in general, continued. It was not after Britain had defeated France in the Seven Years' War (also known as the French and Indian War that France relinquished its holdings east of the Mississippi River to Britain. This was stated in the Treaty of Paris signed by both nations in 1763.",
            "Upstate New York\nMany of the settlers of what then became Central and Western New York came from the New England states. The Central New York Military Tract, where many of the townships were given the names of classical military and literary figures by Robert Harpur, was established to grant land to Revolutionary War veterans. Some of Northern New York was founded by the hundreds of Canadian exiles who had fought in the First and Second Canadian Regiments of the Continental Army, who were banished from Canada due to their rebellion against the Crown.",
            "Northwest Territory\nEuropean exploration of the region began with French-Canadian voyageurs in the 17th century, followed by French missionaries and French fur traders. French-Canadian explorer Jean Nicolet was the first recorded European entrant into the region, landing in 1634 at the current site of Green Bay, Wisconsin (although \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 is stated by some sources as having explored Lake Superior and possibly inland Wisconsin in 1622). The French exercised control from widely separate posts in the region, which they claimed as New France; among these was the post at Fort Detroit, founded in 1701. France ceded the territory to the Kingdom of Great Britain as part of the Indian Reserve in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, after being defeated in the French and Indian War (and Seven Years' War in Europe).",
            "Expulsion of the Acadians\nIn 1753, French troops from Canada marched south and seized and fortified the Ohio Valley. Britain protested the invasion and claimed Ohio for itself. On May 28, 1754, the war began with the Battle of Jumonville Glen. French Officer Ensign de Jumonville and a third of his escort were killed by a British patrol led by George Washington. In retaliation the French and the Indians defeated the British at Fort Necessity. Washington lost a third of his force and surrendered. Major General Edward Braddock's troops were defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela, and William Johnson's troops stopped the French advance at Lake George.",
            "Maine\nCentral Maine was formerly inhabited by people of the Androscoggin tribe of the Abenaki nation, also known as Arosaguntacook. They were driven out of the area in 1690 during King William's War. They were relocated at St. Francis, Canada, which was destroyed by Rogers' Rangers in 1759, and is now Odanak. The other Abenaki tribes suffered several severe defeats, particularly during Dummer's War, with the capture of Norridgewock in 1724 and the defeat of the Pequawket in 1725, which greatly reduced their numbers. They finally withdrew to Canada, where they were settled at B\u00e9cancour and Sillery, and later at St. Francis, along with other refugee tribes from the south.[34]",
            "Schoharie County, New York\nIn the years preceding 1776, as social and political tensions rose in the colony, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County, then on the frontier, fled to Canada. In 1784, after the peace treaty that ended the Revolutionary War and the establishment of states, the new government changed Tryon County's name to Montgomery County to honor United States General Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died trying to capture the city of Quebec.",
            "Chickasaw\nAllied with the British, the Chickasaw were often at war with the French and the Choctaw in the 18th century, such as in the Battle of Ackia on May 26, 1736. Skirmishes continued until France ceded its claims to the region east of the Mississippi River after being defeated by the British in the Seven Years' War (called the French and Indian War in North America).",
            "George Washington\nWashington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he inherited. In his youth, he became a senior officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the French and Indian War. He gradually grew indifferent to British rule with its lack of colonial representation in British Parliament and excessive taxation on the colonies. In 1775, the Second Continental Congress commissioned him as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution. In that command, Washington drove the British out of Boston in 1776, but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he lost New York City. After crossing the Delaware River in the middle of winter, he defeated the British in two battles (Trenton and Princeton), retook New Jersey, and restored momentum to the Patriot cause. His strategy enabled Continental forces to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals, preservation and command of the army, coordination with the Congress, state governors, and their militia, and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington was sometimes outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies, yet was always able to avoid significant defeats which would have resulted in the surrender of his army and the loss of the American Revolution.",
            "George Washington in the French and Indian War\nWashington's military experience began in the French and Indian War with a commission as a major in the militia of the British Province of Virginia. In 1753 Washington was sent as an ambassador from the British crown to the French officials and Indians as far north as present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. The following year he led another expedition to the area to assist in the construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before reaching that point, he and some of his men, accompanied by Indian allies, ambushed a French scouting party. Its leader was killed, although the exact circumstances of his death were disputed. This peacetime act of aggression is seen as one of the first military steps leading to the global Seven Years' War. The French responded by attacking fortifications Washington erected following the ambush, forcing his surrender. Released on parole, Washington and his troops returned to Virginia.",
            "Seven Years' War\nThe British government was close to bankruptcy, and Britain now faced the delicate task of pacifying its new French-Canadian subjects as well as the many American Indian tribes who had supported France. In 1763, Pontiac's War broke out as a group of Indian tribes in the Great Lakes region and the Northwest (the modern American Midwest) said to have been led by the Ottawa chief Pontiac (whose role as the leader of the confederation seems to have been exaggerated by the British), unhappy with the eclipse of French power, rebelled against British rule. The Indians had long established congenial and friendly relations with the French fur traders, and the Anglo-American fur traders who had replaced the French had engaged in business practices that enraged the Indians, who complained about being cheated when they sold their furs.[124] Moreover, the Indians feared that with the coming of British rule might lead to white settlers displacing them off their land, whereas it was known that the French had only come as fur traders.[124] Pontiac's War was a major conflict in which the British temporarily lost control of the Great Lakes-Northwest regions to the Indians.[125] By the middle of 1763, the only forts the British held in the region were Fort Detroit (modern Detroit, Michigan ), Fort Niagara (modern Youngstown, New York) and Fort Pitt (modern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) with the rest all being lost to the Indians.[126] It was only with the British victory at the Battle of Bushy Run that prevented a complete collapse of British power in the Great Lakes region.[127] King George\u00a0III's Proclamation of 1763, which forbade white settlement beyond the crest of the Appalachians, was intended to appease the Indians but led to considerable outrage in the Thirteen Colonies, whose inhabitants were eager to acquire native lands. The Quebec Act of 1774, similarly intended to win over the loyalty of French Canadians, also spurred resentment among American colonists.[128] The act protected Catholic religion and French language, which enraged the Americans, but the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois remained loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolution and did not rebel.",

For many years, the nearby colonies, especially the provinces of New Hampshire and New York, disputed control of the area (then called the New Hampshire Grants).

He served from 1755 until 1758 as colonel and commander of the Virginia Regiment, directing the provincial defenses against French and Indian raids and building the regiment into one of the best-trained provincial militias of the time. He led the regiment as part of the 1758 expedition of General John Forbes that successfully drove the French from Fort Duquesne, during which he and some of his companies were involved in a friendly fire incident.

Most of these Canadian and American \"voyageurs\" in the fur trade era were loners who became friendly with, and sometimes married, Native Americans. Some lyrics of this song heard by and before 1860 tell the story of a trader who fell in love with the daughter of the Oneida Iroquois pine tree chief Shenandoah (1710\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1816), who lived in the central New York state town of Oneida Castle. He was a co-founder of the Oneida Academy, which became Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, and is buried on the campus grounds.",
            "Cooperstown, New York\nThe village was developed within part of the Cooper Patent, which William Cooper \u2013 who later became a county judge \u2013 purchased in 1785 from Colonel George Croghan, former Deputy to Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Northern District. The land amounted to 10,000 acres (40\u00a0km2). William Cooper founded a village on Otsego Lake. His son James Fenimore Cooper grew up in the frontier town. He later became a noted American author with The Leatherstocking Tales, a series of historical novels that includes The Last of the Mohicans.",
            "Fort Ticonderoga\nDuring the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated the city in March 1776. The Americans held the fort until June 1777, when British forces under General John Burgoyne occupied high ground above it; the threat resulted in the Continental Army troops being withdrawn from the fort and its surrounding defenses. The only direct attack on the fort during the Revolution took place in September 1777, when John Brown led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders.",
            "Northwest Indian War\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered Revolutionary War hero General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new Legion of the United States late in 1793. He led his men to a decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day Ohio, in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.",
            "Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette\nBorn in Chavaniac, in the province of Auvergne in south central France, Lafayette came from a wealthy landowning family. He followed its martial tradition, and was commissioned an officer at age 13. He became convinced that the American cause in its revolutionary war was noble, and traveled to the New World seeking glory in it. There, he was made a major general; however, the 19-year-old was initially not given troops to command. Wounded during the Battle of Brandywine, he still managed to organize an orderly retreat. He served with distinction in the Battle of Rhode Island. In the middle of the war, he returned home to lobby for an increase in French support. He again sailed to America in 1780, and was given senior positions in the Continental Army.  In 1781, troops in Virginia under his command blocked forces led by Cornwallis until other American and French forces could position themselves for the decisive Siege of Yorktown.",
            "Beaver Wars\nAt this time, conflict began to grow quickly between the Iroquois and the Indigenous people supported by the French. The Iroquois inhabited the region of present-day New York south of Lake Ontario and west of the Hudson River. The Iroquois lands comprised a large ethnic island, surrounded on all sides but the south by Algonquian-speaking nations, all traditional enemies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding the Shawnee to the west in the Ohio Country. Their rivals also included the Iroquoian-speaking Neutral Nation and Huron confederacies, who lived on the western shore of Lake Ontario and southern shore of Lake Huron to the west, respectively, and the Susquehannock to their south. While part of the Iroquoian-speaking language family, these tribes historically were competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who at that time had Five Nations in their confederacy.",
            "British Army during the American Revolutionary War\nLarge numbers of scouts and skirmishers were also formed from loyalists and Native Americans. The renowned Robert Rogers formed the Queen's Rangers, while his brother James Rogers led the King's Rangers. Loyalist pioneer John Butler raised the provincial regiment known as Butler's Rangers, who were heavily engaged in the Northern colonies during which they were accused of participating in massacres at Wyoming and Cherry Valley. The majority of Native Americans favoured the British cause and Mohawk leader Joseph Brant commanded Iroquois and Loyalists in campaigns on the New York Frontier. Colonel Thomas Brown led another group of King's Rangers in the Southern colonies, defending East Florida from invasion, raiding the southern frontier and participating in the conquest of the southern colonies. Colonial Governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore raised a regiment composed entirely of freed slaves known as the Ethiopian Regiment, which served through the early skirmishes of the war.",
            "Northwest Territory\nA new colony, named Charlotina, was proposed for the southern Great Lakes region. However, facing armed opposition by Native Americans, the British issued the Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited white colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. This action angered American colonists interested in expansion, as well as those who had already settled in the area. In 1774, by the Quebec Act, Britain annexed the region to the Province of Quebec in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade. The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the American Revolution.",
            "Battle of Fallen Timbers\nBefore withdrawing from the area, Wayne began the construction of a line of forts along the Maumee River, from its mouth at present-day Toledo, Ohio to its origins in today's Indiana. Wayne then returned to Fort Presque Isle (present day Erie, Pennsylvania), where he died in 1796. The last of these forts along the Maumee was named Fort Wayne in his honor. The fort eventually developed into the modern city of Fort Wayne. Behind this line of forts, white settlers moved into the Ohio country, leading to the admission of the state of Ohio in 1803. Tecumseh, a young Shawnee veteran of Fallen Timbers who refused to sign the Greenville Treaty, would renew American Indian resistance in the years ahead.",
            "Pontiac's War\nThe tribes of the pays d'en haut consisted of three basic groups. The first group was composed of tribes of the Great Lakes region: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi, who spoke Algonquian languages; and the Huron, who spoke an Iroquoian language. They had long been allied with French habitants, with whom they lived, traded, and intermarried. Great Lakes Native Americans were alarmed to learn that they were under British sovereignty after the French loss of North America. When a British garrison took possession of Fort Detroit from the French in 1760, local Native Americans cautioned them that \"this country was given by God to the Indians.\"[13]",
            "Battle of Fort Washington\nJohn Corbin was in charge of firing a small cannon at the top of a ridge, today known as Fort Tryon Park. During an assault by the Hessians, John was killed, leaving his cannon unmanned. Margaret Corbin had been with her husband on the battlefield the entire time, and, after witnessing his death, she immediately took his place at the cannon, continuing to fire until her arm, chest, and jaw were hit by enemy fire, thereby becoming the first known woman combatant in the American Revolution .",
            "Northwest Ordinance\nThe territory was acquired by Great Britain from France following victory in the Seven Years' War and the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Great Britain took over the Ohio Country, as its eastern portion was known, but a few months later closed it to new European settlement by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The Crown tried to restrict settlement of the thirteen colonies between the Appalachians and the Atlantic, which raised colonial tensions among those who wanted to move west. With the colonials' victory in the American Revolutionary War and signing of the 1783 Treaty of Paris, the United States claimed the territory, as well as the areas south of the Ohio. The territories were subject to overlapping and conflicting claims of the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and Virginia dating from their colonial past. The British were active in some of the border area until after the Louisiana Purchase and the War of 1812.",
            "Batavia, New York\nOne of the provisions of the sale was that Morris needed to settle the Indian title to the land, so he arranged for his son Thomas Morris to negotiate with the Iroquois at Geneseo, New York in 1797. About 3,000 Iroquois, mostly Senecas, arrived for the negotiation. Seneca chief and orator Red Jacket was adamantly against the sale, but his influence was thwarted by freely distributed liquor and trinkets given to the women. In the end he acquiesced and signed the Treaty of Big Tree, in which the tribe sold their rights to the land except for a small portion for $100,000. Mary Jemison, known as The White Woman of the Genesee, who had been captured in a raid and married her Seneca captor, proved to be an able negotiator for the tribe and helped win more favorable terms for them. In the negotiations Horatio Jones was the translator and William Wadsworth provided his unfinished home. The land was then surveyed under the supervision of Joseph Ellicott, a monumental task of the biggest land survey ever attempted to that time.",

            "New France\nThese British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.",
            "Ohio Country\nThe British defeated the French and their allies. Meanwhile, other British and colonial forces drove the French from Fort Duquesne and building Fort Pitt, the origin of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the 1763 Treaty of Paris, France ceded control of the entire Ohio region to Great Britain, without consulting its native allies, who still believed they had territorial claims. Colonies such as Pennsylvania and Virginia claimed some of the westward lands by their original charters.",
            "Millard Fillmore\nNathaniel Fillmore was the son of Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. (1739-1814), a native of Franklin, Connecticut who became one of the earliest settlers of Bennington when it was founded in the territory then called the New Hampshire Grants.[4] Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. was a member of the Green Mountain Boys, and served as an ensign and first lieutenant during the American Revolution.[5] In 1767, Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. married Hepzibah Wood (1747-1783), the mother of Nathaniel Fillmore and grandmother of Millard Fillmore.[5] Members of the Fillmore family had resided in New England for several generations; Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. was the son of John Fillmore (1702-1777), who lived in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and worked as a ship's captain.[6][7] John Fillmore was the son of John Fillmore Sr. (1676-1712), a native of Manchester, England who was also a mariner and died as a prisoner of the French on the island of Martinique during Queen Anne's War.[8]",
            "Toledo, Ohio\nThe area was not settled by European-Americans until 1795 and later. After the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War, the regional tribes allied in the Western Confederacy, fighting a series of battles in what became known as the Northwest Indian War in an effort to repulse American settlers from the country west of the Appalachians and north of the Ohio River. They were finally defeated in 1794 at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. This loose affiliation of tribes included the Wyandot and Council of Three Fires. By a treaty in 1795, they ceded large areas of territory in Ohio to the United States, opening lands for European-American settlement.",
            "Shawnee\nThe Shawnee later combined with the Miami into a great fighting force in the Ohio Valley, after the Revolution, during the Northwest Indian War between the United States and a confederation of Native American tribes. After being defeated at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, most of the Shawnee bands signed the Treaty of Greenville the next year. They were forced to cede large parts of their homeland to the new United States. Other Shawnee groups rejected this treaty, migrating independently to Missouri west of the Mississippi River, where they settled along Apple Creek near Cape Girardeau.",
            "Andrew Jackson\nBorn in the colonial Carolinas to a Scotch-Irish family in the decade before the American Revolutionary War, Jackson became a frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson Robards. He served briefly in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate representing Tennessee. After resigning, he served as a justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1798 until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known as the Hermitage, and became a wealthy, slaveowning planter. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year. He led troops during the Creek War of 1813\u20131814, winning the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The subsequent Treaty of Fort Jackson required the Creek surrender of vast lands in present-day Alabama and Georgia. In the concurrent war against the British, Jackson's victory in 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans made him a national hero. Jackson then led U.S. forces in the First Seminole War, which caused the annexation of Florida from Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He ran for president in 1824, winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote. As no candidate won an electoral majority, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams in a contingent election. In reaction to the alleged \"corrupt bargain\" between Adams and Henry Clay and the ambitious agenda of President Adams, Jackson's supporters founded the Democratic Party.",
            "Benedict Arnold\nArnold was born in Connecticut and was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 (allowing American forces time to prepare New York's defenses), the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut (after which he was promoted to major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that halted his combat career for several years.",

The Native Americans were shown the wonders and power of France, including a visit to Versailles, Ch\u00e2teau de Marly and Fontainebleau. They hunted with Louis XV in the royal forest and saw an opera. During the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe), France was defeated by Great Britain and in 1763 ceded its lands east of the Mississippi River to that nation. France made a separate deal with Spain, which took nominal control of much of the Illinois Country west of the great river.",
            "French and Indian War\nThe third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon, in which 3,600 Frenchmen defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia, and Indian allies outside the fort which the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga. Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe. Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst, victor at Louisbourg.",

The victorious Jefferson appointed Pinckney as Minister to Spain (1801\u00e2\u20ac\u201c05). He tried but did not succeed in gaining cession by Spain of the Floridas to the United States. He facilitated Spanish acquiescence in the transfer of Louisiana from France to the United States in 1803 by the Louisiana Purchase.",

            "French and Indian War\nIn the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians. His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin followed the route that C\u00e9loron had mapped out four years earlier. C\u00e9loron, however, had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie's south shore near Erie, Pennsylvania, and he had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. He then constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford, Pennsylvania, designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson was a chief of the Mingo Indians, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and eating his father. He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.[28]",
            "King Philip's War\nFrench interests in Maine originated in the fur trade and the sale of fish, both to France. The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French Jesuits paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the Abenaki. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near Norridgewock, Maine and led by Jesuit Father S\u00e9bastien Rale. Two other mission towns were established, one based around Castine, Maine (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the St. Francis River between New Brunswick and Maine.",
            "Shawnee\nIn the Treaty of Camp Charlotte ending this war (1774), Cornstalk and the Shawnee were compelled by the British to recognize the same Ohio River boundary as that established with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (\"Six Nations\") by the 1768 Fort Stanwix treaty. The Shawnee ceded all claims to the \"hunting grounds\" of West Virginia and Kentucky. Many other Shawnee leaders refused to recognize this boundary, however. A Shawnee party attacked Daniel Boone in Kentucky in 1775.",
            "New France\nFort Duquesne, located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, guarded the most important strategic location in the west at the time of the Seven Years' War. It was built to ensure that the Ohio River valley remained under French control. A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under Claude-Pierre P\u00e9caudy de Contrec\u0153ur drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.",
            "Battle of Fort Duquesne\nAfter repulsing this advance party the French, deserted by some of their native allies and vastly outnumbered by the approaching Forbes, blew up their magazines and burnt Fort Duquesne. In November the French withdrew from the Ohio Valley and British colonists erected Fort Pitt on the site.",
            "History of Massachusetts\nDuring Queen Anne's War, Massachusetts men were involved in the Conquest of Acadia (1710), which became the Province of Nova Scotia. The province was also involved in Dummer's War, in which Indian tribes were driven from northern New England. In 1745, during King George's War, Massachusetts provincial forces successfully besieged Fortress Louisbourg. The fortress was returned to France at the end of the war, angering many colonists who viewed it as a threat to their security. During the French and Indian War, Governor William Shirley was instrumental in the Expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia and trying to settle them in New England. After the expulsion, Shirley also was involved in transporting New England Planters to settle Nova Scotia on the former Acadian farms.[35] Many troops from Massachusetts participated in the successful Siege of Havana in 1762. Britain's victory in the war led to its acquisition of New France, removing the immediate northern threat to Massachusetts that the French had posed.",
            "George Washington in the French and Indian War\nBorn into a well-to-do Virginia family in Bridges Creek near Fredericksburg in 1732 [O.S. 1731], Washington was schooled locally until the age of 15. His father's sudden death occurred when Washington was just a mere eleven years old. This completely eliminated the possibility of schooling in England, and his mother rejected attempts to place him in the Royal Navy.[2] Thanks to the connection by marriage of his half-brother Lawrence to the wealthy Fairfax family, Washington was appointed surveyor of Culpeper County in 1749; he was just 17 years old. Washington's brother had purchased an interest in the Ohio Company, a land acquisition and settlement company whose objective was the settlement of Virginia's frontier areas, including the Ohio Country, territory north and west of the Ohio River.[3] Its investors also included Virginia's Royal Governor, Robert Dinwiddie, who appointed Washington a major in the provincial militia in February 1753.[4][5]",
            "Naval Air Station Pensacola\nThe site now occupied by NAS Pensacola has been controlled by varying nations. In 1559, Spanish explorer Don Tristan de Luna founded a colony on Santa Rosa Island, considered the first European settlement of the Pensacola area. The Spanish built the wooden Fort San Carlos de Austria on this bluff in 1697\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1698. Although besieged by Indians in 1707, the fort was not taken. Spain was competing in North America with the French, who settled lower Louisiana and the Illinois Country and areas to the North. The French destroyed this fort when they captured Pensacola in 1719. After Great Britain defeated the French in the Seven Years' War and exchanging some territory with Spain, British colonists took over this site and West Florida in 1763."

Studio recordings from this time include the single \"Anything But Lonely\" from Aspects of Love and two solo albums: the 1988 album The Trees They Grow So High, a collection of folk songs accompanied by piano, and the 1989 album The Songs That Got Away, a compilation of obscure musical theatre songs from shows by such composers as Irving Berlin and Stephen Sondheim. Brightman also sang the song \"Make Believe\" during the credits of the children's film Grandpa; Howard Blake composed the music and wrote the lyrics.[33]",
            "Andrew Lloyd Webber\nLloyd Webber also premiered The Phantom of the Opera in 1986, inspired by the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel. He wrote the part of Christine for his then-wife, Sarah Brightman, who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed Evita. Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for Phantom with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe, with whom Lloyd Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in both the West End and on Broadway; in January 2006 it overtook Cats as the longest-running musical on Broadway. On 11 February 2012, Phantom of the Opera played its 10,000th show on Broadway.[20]",

            "Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)\nThe theatrical songwriting team of Maury Yeston and Arthur Kopit created a musical based on the story which investors backed out of after Webber's version became a huge hit. Erik is portrayed as much kinder and more sympathetic, and also with more of a sense of humor. His mother was a singer in the Opera and, having discovered that she was pregnant with an illegitimate child, swallowed poison. This is the reason for his disfigurement. He was born within the catacombs of the opera house and lived there his entire life. His mother died when he was a young child. His father, Gerard Carriere, was the manager and kept him safe all that time. Over the years, Erik became the creative driving force for the opera company. No artistic decision was made without Carriere seeking his approval.[citation needed]",

Charles Hart, a young and then-relatively unknown lyricist, later rewrote many of the lyrics, along with original lyrics for \"Think of Me\". Some of Stilgoe's original contributions are still present in the final version, however.[16]",
            "Christine Daa\u00e9\nThe novel was filmed several times. The first film adaptation was made in Germany in 1915, with Nils Chrisander (1884-1947) as the Phantom of the Opera and Aud Egede-Nissen (1893-1974) as Christine Daa\u00c3\u00a9. Many critics consider the Filming of 1925, by Carl Laemmles Studio Universal Pictures, as the most successful. The role of the phantom played here Lon Chaney. The same studio tried in 1943 with a sound film of Arthur Lubin to follow this success. The film used to a large extent the still existing scenes of the silent film. Claude Rains played the phantom.\nIn 1960, a Spanish society turned a very free adaptation of the subject under the title El Fantasma de la Operetta . In 1962 the British production company Hammer Films focused on the horror genre. Another film adaptation was made in 1974 by 20th Century Fox, who moved the event to New York and changed the story very much. This film was released as The Phantom of the Paradise. The 1989 version, with Freddy-Krueger star Robert Englund in the title role, focused on the potential for violence of the phantom. On the other hand, in the same year as a German-French-Italian-American co-production, a TV-Secondary was created, which put the melodramatic love story in the foreground and waived television rights on Splatter effects. The phantom embodied Charles Dance . In 1998 the famous Italian Horrorfilm director, Dario Argento, starred with Julian Sands in the lead role of the fabric, but was not particularly successful at Kinokasse.\nFinally, in 2004, Joel Schumacher produced a film version that was inspired by the musical of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Here played Gerard Butler , the role of the Phantom. Originally there was already a filming based on the musical in the early 1990s, with the main actors of the premiere: Michael Crawford as the phantom and Sarah Brightman as Christine. Brightman was married to Lloyd Webber at the time, but shortly before the planned pre-production the marriage was broken and the filming was canceled.",

They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw an effective way to make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: \"I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career.

However, when Holmes finally confronts the Phantom, he claims that he cannot speak without his mask, as his mother forced him to wear it whenever he wished to speak as a child, and he is not Edouard LaFosse.

There is an operatic kind of music, of singing, of staging. There are opera audiences, and there is an opera sensibility. There are opera houses.

            "Scopes Trial\nFurther, the court held that while the statute forbade the teaching of evolution (as the court had defined it), it did not require the teaching of any other doctrine, so that it did not benefit any one religious doctrine or sect over the others.",
            "History of Protestantism in the United States\nThe Scopes Monkey Trial was an American legal case that tested the Butler Act, which made it unlawful, in any state-funded educational establishment in Tennessee, \"to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.\"[23] This is often interpreted as meaning that the law forbade the teaching of any aspect of the theory of evolution. The case was a critical turning point in the United States' creation-evolution controversy.",
            "Scopes Trial\nOn the sixth day of the trial, the defense ran out of witnesses. The judge declared that all of the defense testimony on the Bible was irrelevant and should not be presented to the jury (which had been excluded during the defense). On the seventh day of the trial, the defense asked the judge to call Bryan as a witness to question him on the Bible, as their own experts had been rendered irrelevant; Darrow had planned this the day before and called Bryan a \"Bible expert\". This move surprised those present in the court, as Bryan was a counsel for the prosecution and Bryan himself (according to a journalist reporting the trial) never made a claim of being an expert, although he did tout his knowledge of the Bible.[29] This testimony revolved around several questions regarding Biblical stories and Bryan's beliefs (as shown below); this testimony culminated in Bryan declaring that Darrow was using the court to \"slur the Bible\" while Darrow replied that Bryan's statements on the Bible were \"foolish\".[30]",
            "Inherit the Wind (1960 film)\nInherit the Wind is a fictionalized account of the 1925 Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial, which resulted in John T. Scopes's conviction for teaching Charles Darwin's theory of evolution to a high school science class, contrary to a Tennessee state law. The characters of Matthew Harrison Brady, Henry Drummond, Bertram Cates and E. K. Hornbeck correspond to the historical figures of William Jennings Bryan, Clarence Darrow, Scopes, and H. L. Mencken, respectively. However, Lee and Lawrence state in a note at the opening of the play on which the film is based that it is not meant to be a historical account,[6] and many events were substantially altered or invented.[7][8][9] For instance, the characters of the preacher and his daughter were fictional, the townspeople were not hostile towards those who had come to Dayton for the trial, and Bryan offered to pay Scopes' fine if he was convicted. Bryan did die shortly after the trial's conclusion, but his death occurred five days later in his sleep.[8][9] Political commentator Steve Benen said of the drama's inaccuracies: \"Scopes issued no plea for empathy, there was no fiancee and the real Scopes was never arrested. Lawrence explained in a 1996 interview that the play's purpose was to criticize McCarthyism and defend intellectual freedom. According to Lawrence, \"we used the teaching of evolution as a parable, a metaphor for any kind of mind control ... It's not about science versus religion. It's about the right to think.\"[4]",
            "Coram nobis\nIn 1858, the Tennessee General Assembly enacted a statute which codified the procedure for seeking the writ of coram nobis, expanded the grounds upon which a claim for relief under the writ could be based, and placed a time limitation upon its filings which provided that the writ of coram nobis may be had within one year from the rendition of the judgment. Both at common law and under the 1858 statutory enactment, however, the writ of coram nobis was limited in scope to civil proceedings.",
            "Scopes Trial\nMalone responded for the defense in a speech that was universally considered the oratorical climax of the trial.[27] Arousing fears of \"inquisitions\", Malone argued that the Bible should be preserved in the realm of theology and morality and not put into a course of science. In his conclusion, Malone declared that Bryan's \"duel to the death\" against evolution should not be made one-sided by a court ruling that took away the chief witnesses for the defense. Malone promised that there would be no duel because \"there is never a duel with the truth.\" The courtroom went wild when Malone finished, and Scopes declared Malone's speech to be the dramatic highpoint of the entire trial and insisted that part of the reason Bryan wanted to go on the stand was to regain some of his tarnished glory.[28]",

            "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer\nThe film focuses on an evidentiary hearing held in Marion County, Florida in February 2003, which was the site of some but not all of Wuornos' murders for which she was convicted and sentenced to death. It shows the work of the Office of Capital Collateral Regional counsel, led by attorney Joseph T. Hobson, who is both interviewed and featured in the film and who seeks to vacate Wuornos' death sentences. It shows Judge Victor Musleh presiding over these proceedings and assistant state attorney, now judge, James McCune, who defended the death sentences for the State of Florida. Hobson is shown vigorously cross-examining Wuornos' trial counsel, Steven Glazer, aka \"Dr. Legal\". Glazer was the unflattering subject of a prior Broomfield documentary on Aileen Wuornos, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer.  It was Hobson's line of attack that the efficacy of his client's (Wuornos') trial strategy was compromised by Glazer's pecuniary and self-promotional aims.",

            "Scopes Trial\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) offered to defend anyone accused of teaching the theory of evolution in defiance of the Butler Act. On April 5, 1925, George Rappleyea, local manager for the Cumberland Coal and Iron Company, arranged a meeting with county superintendent of schools Walter White and local attorney Sue K. Hicks at Robinson's Drug Store, convincing them that the controversy of such a trial would give Dayton much needed publicity. According to Robinson, Rappleyea said, \"As it is, the law is not enforced. If you win, it will be enforced. If I win, the law will be repealed. We're game, aren't we?\" The men then summoned 24-year-old John T. Scopes, a Dayton high school science and math teacher. The group asked Scopes to admit to teaching the theory of evolution.[10][11]",
            "Scopes Trial\nOn the seventh day of the trial, Clarence Darrow took the unorthodox step of calling William Jennings Bryan, counsel for the prosecution, to the stand as a witness in an effort to demonstrate that belief in the historicity of the Bible and its many accounts of miracles was unreasonable. Bryan accepted, on the understanding that Darrow would in turn submit to questioning by Bryan. Although Hays would claim in his autobiography that the cross-examination of Bryan was unplanned, Darrow spent the night before in preparation. The scientists the defense had brought to Dayton\u2014and Charles Francis Potter, a modernist minister who had engaged in a series of public debates on evolution with the fundamentalist preacher John Roach Straton\u2014prepared topics and questions for Darrow to address to Bryan on the witness stand.[31] Kirtley Mather, chairman of the geology department at Harvard and also a devout Baptist, played Bryan and answered questions as he believed Bryan would.[32][33] Raulston had adjourned court to the stand on the courthouse lawn, ostensibly because he was \"afraid of the building\" with so many spectators crammed into the courtroom, but probably because of the stifling heat.[34]",

Raulston accelerated the convening of the grand jury and \"... all but instructed the grand jury to indict Scopes, despite the meager evidence against him and the widely reported stories questioning whether the willing defendant had ever taught evolution in the classroom\".[16] Scopes was charged with having taught from the chapter on evolution to an April 24, 1925, high-school class in violation of the Butler Act and nominally arrested, though he was never actually detained. Paul Patterson, owner of The Baltimore Sun, put up $500 in bail for Scopes.[17][18]",

It was the first state created from territory under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government. Apart from the former Thirteen Colonies only Vermont and Kentucky predate Tennessee's statehood, and neither was ever a federal territory.[33] The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, Article I, Section 31, states that the beginning point for identifying the boundary is the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it, and basically runs the extreme heights of mountain chains through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee past the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (Unicoi Mountain) to the southern boundary of the state; all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line are included in the boundaries and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee. Part of the provision also stated that the limits and jurisdiction of the state would include future land acquisition, referencing possible land trade with other states, or the acquisition of territory from west of the Mississippi River.",

She was signed for the chorus and as understudy for the lead, but the show unfortunately closed on opening night.[3] She had better luck with her next outing, Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music. Additional Broadway credits include 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Peter Pan, Baby, Take Me Along, Teddy & Alice, the 1989 revival of Sweeney Todd, in which she portrayed Mrs. Lovett, Beauty and the Beast, in which she originated the role of Mrs. Potts, Bells Are Ringing, and The Boy from Oz where she portrayed Peter Allen's mother Marion.[4]",

This production included songs revised for her.[34] In 2010, Williams starred in a new Broadway musical revue entitled Sondheim on Sondheim, a look at Stephen Sondheim through his music, film and videotaped interviews. Sondheim ran from March 19 to June 13 at Studio 54 in New York City.[35] In 2013, she starred as Jessie Mae Watts in the Horton Foote play The Trip to Bountiful, which was later turned into a 2014 television film.[36] In 2014, she starred in the Broadway musical, After Midnight[37] and in 2015 she appeared in a PBS production of Show Boat as Julie La Verne.[38]",

She became the standby for Glinda in the San Francisco company of the show from February 2010 to September 2010, when the production closed. She was a standby for several roles in the original Broadway musical Lysistrata Jones. She often covers many female roles as a swing in Wicked's Broadway company.",

Kerry Ellis, who played Elphaba in the West End and on Broadway, recorded \"I'm Not that Girl\" for the fifth anniversary edition of the original Broadway cast recording. She also recorded her own rock version of \"Defying Gravity\". Both songs were produced by British musician Brian May and were featured on her extended play Wicked in Rock (2008) and debut album Anthems (2010). She performed her version of \"Defying Gravity\" at the 2008 Royal Variety Performance alongside May on guitar. A dance remix of her rock version of \"Defying Gravity\" was later released in 2011. Louise Dearman, who has played both Elphaba and Glinda in the West End, released an acoustic version of \"Defying Gravity\" for the Wicked edition of her album Here Comes the Sun. Her former co-star and London Elphaba Rachel Tucker also covered \"Defying Gravity\" on her debut album The Reason (2013). Rapper Drake and singer Mika both sampled the musical's song in their songs \"Popular\" and \"Popular Song\" respectively.[188] American band Wheatus released an EP 'The Lightning EP' in their 'Pop, Songs & Death' series that was inspired by Wicked with heavy influences throughout including lyrics in \"Real Girl\" such as \"You were the perfect colour, Bright green lady\" with Elphaba and Scarecrow-like characters in the video.

Stephanie J. Block played Elphaba in all of the workshops, (she was the original Elphaba in the 1st National Tour and joined the Broadway cast later on) before fellow performer Idina Menzel was cast in the role in late 2000. In early 2000, the creators recruited New York producer David Stone, who began the transition of the workshop production into a full Broadway production. Joe Mantello was brought in as director and Wayne Cilento as choreographer while Tony Award\u2013winning designer Eugene Lee created the set and visual style for the production based on both W. W.

They are made by her father using special glass beads another man (Turtleheart, possibly her biological father) taught him to make, which make the shoes appear silver or ruby depending on the light. They are enchanted by Glinda (the Good Witch of the North) to give her the necessary balance to walk. In the Broadway musical adaption of the book, Elphaba is the one who enchants the shoes.

In what is perhaps the most prolonged and complicated air campaign in history, the Battle of Britain contributed significantly to the delay and subsequent indefinite postponement of Hitler's plans for an invasion of the United Kingdom (Operation Sealion). In the House of Commons on 20 August, prompted by the ongoing efforts of the RAF, Prime Minister Winston Churchill eloquently made a speech to the nation, where he said \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\".[13]",

Aubrey \"Sinbad\" de Lisle Inniss (1916-2003) was the sole Barbadian to serve as a pilot during the Battle of Britain. Inniss was born in Barbados to a British family and joined the RAF in 1939. During the Battle, he flew a Bristol Blenheim IF night fighter with No. 236 Squadron RAF and was responsible for shooting down a Heinkel He 111 in September 1940. Inniss, who became an ace during his subsequent war service, survived the conflict and retired from the RAF in 1957.

            "European theatre of World War II\nThus, the fall of France left Britain and the Commonwealth to stand alone. The British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, resigned during the battle and was replaced by Winston Churchill. Fortunately for Britain, much of its army escaped capture from the northern French port of Dunkirk, where hundreds (if not thousands) of tiny civilian boats were used to ferry troops from the beaches to the waiting warships. There is much debate over whether German Panzer divisions could have defeated these soldiers alone if they had pressed forward, since the tank divisions were overextended and would require extensive refitting; in any case, Hitler elected to follow the advice of the leader of German air forces Hermann G\u00f6ring and allow the Luftwaffe alone to attack the Allied forces until German infantry was able to advance, giving the British a window for the evacuation. Later, many of the evacuated troops would form an important part and the center of the army that landed at Normandy on D-Day.",

New Zealanders in the RNZAF and RAF included pilots such as the first RAF ace of WW2, Flying Officer Cobber Kain, Alan Deere, whose Nine Lives was one of the first post war accounts of combat, and leaders such as World War I ace, Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park, who commanded 11 Group, responsible for the defence of London in the Battle of Britain, the air defence of Malta and in the closing stages of the war, the RAF in South East Asia. Through accident or design, several RAF units came to be mostly manned by RNZAF pilots (for example No. 243 Squadron RAF in Singapore, No. 258 Squadron RAF in the UK and several Wildcat and Hellcat units of the FAA - leading some texts to claim these types of aircraft were used by the RNZAF).",

Churchill concluded his famous 18 June 'Battle of Britain' speech in the House of Commons by referring to pilots and aircrew who fought the Battle: \"...\u00c2\u00a0if the British Empire and its Commonwealth lasts for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'\"[282][nb 23]",

His mother did not like him being out at night, and feared he might catch cold; he partly resembled the character of Private Pike.[5] An elderly lance corporal in the 10th Hertfordshire often referred to fighting under Kitchener against the \"Fuzzy Wuzzies\" (Hadendoa) and was the model for Corporal Jones. Other influences included the work of comedians such as Will Hay whose film Oh, Mr Porter! featured a pompous ass, an old man and a young man which gave him Mainwaring, Godfrey and Pike.

Facing odds of four against one the RAF held off the Luftwaffe, forcing Hermann Wilhelm G\u00f6ring to withdraw his forces and more importantly indefinitely postpone invasion plans. This proved the first major turning point of the War. After that most of the strength of the Luftwaffe was diverted to the war against the Soviet Union leaving German cities vulnerable to British and later American air bombings. As a result of the victory, Great Britain was used by U.S and other Allied forces as a base from which to begin the D-Day landings in June 1944 and the liberation of Nazi-occupied Western Europe. Nevertheless, German raids continued on British cities albeit on a smaller and less destructive scale for the rest of the war, and later the V1 Flying Bomb and V-2 ballistic missile were both used against Britain. However, the balance of bomb tonnage being dropped shifted greatly in favour of the RAF as Bomber Command gained in strength. By 1942, Bomber Command could put 1,000 bombers over one German city.",

Fighting in Belgium and France, the BEF and a portion of the French Army became outflanked by the Germans and retreated to the area around the port of Dunkirk. More than 400,000 soldiers were trapped in the pocket as the German Army closed in for the kill. Unexpectedly, the German Panzer attack halted for several days at a critical juncture. For years, it was assumed that Adolf Hitler ordered the German Army to suspend the attack, favouring bombardment by the Luftwaffe. However, according to the Official War Diary of Army Group A, its commander, Generaloberst Gerd von Rundstedt, ordered the halt to allow maintenance on his tanks, half of which were out of service, and to protect his flanks which were exposed and, he thought, vulnerable.[7] Hitler merely validated the order several hours after the fact.[8] This lull in the action gave the British and French a few days to fortify their defences and evacuate by sea. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, ordered any ship or boat available, large or small, to collect the stranded soldiers. 338,226 men (including 123,000 French soldiers) were evacuated \u2013 the miracle of Dunkirk, as Churchill called it. It took over 900 vessels to evacuate the BEF, with two-thirds of those rescued embarking via the harbour, and over 100,000 taken off the beaches. More than 40,000 vehicles as well as massive amounts of other military equipment and supplies were left behind, their value being regarded as less than that of trained fighting men. The British evacuation of Dunkirk through the English Channel was codenamed Operation Dynamo. Forty thousand Allied soldiers (some who carried on fighting after the official evacuation) were captured or forced to make their own way home through a variety of routes including via neutral Spain.

On 15 September 1940, now known as \"Battle of Britain Day\", Homes used his Hawker Hurricane to destroy a Dornier Do-17 bomber over London by ramming but at the loss of his own aircraft (and almost his own life) in one of the defining moments of the Battle of Britain. Holmes, making a head-on attack, found his guns inoperative. He flew his plane into the top-side of the German bomber, cutting off the rear tail section with his wing and causing the bomber to dive out of control and crash. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack, while the injured Holmes bailed out of his plane and survived.[27] As the RAF did not practice ramming as an air combat tactic, this was considered an impromptu manoeuvre, and an act of selfless courage. Holmes was feted by the press as a war hero who saved Buckingham Palace. This event became one of the defining moments of the Battle of Britain and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands who had witnessed the event.[28] This event is depicted - with considerable artistic licence - in the film.",

In the end Britain emerged victorious, and this caused Adolf Hitler to give up his plan to invade Britain. Other prominent air force operations during the Second World War include the Allied bombing of Germany during 1942\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1944, and the Red Air Force operations in support of strategic ground offensives on the Eastern Front.  The aerial warfare in Pacific Ocean theatre was of a comparable strategic significance to the Battle of Britain but was largely conducted by the US and Japanese naval aviation services and not by air forces.",
            "Battle of Britain\nWinston Churchill summed up the effect of the battle and the contribution of RAF Fighter Command, RAF Bomber Command, RAF Coastal Command and the Fleet Air Arm with the words, \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\".[292] Pilots who fought in the battle have been known as The Few ever since; at times being specially commemorated on 15 September, \"Battle of Britain Day\". On this day in 1940, the Luftwaffe embarked on their largest bombing attack yet, forcing the engagement of the entirety of the RAF in defence of London and the South East, which resulted in a decisive British victory that proved to mark a turning point in Britain's favour.[293][294]",
            "British women's literature of World War I\nThere are numerous female poets that remain popular today. Dissimilar to the idea that their writings would be overshadowed by war stories told by men, these poets have many publications. Vera Brittain has written poems and stories about the Great War.[14] Not only was Brittain a writer, she was a nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment.[14] This shows the support women had for the war and the importance they played in a non-combative manner. In addition, Lady Margaret Sackville refers to the women during the Great War as life-savers.[31] More specifically, Sackville believes that women are supporting a war that is unnecessary in her poem The Pageant of War.[32] Rupert Brooke attributed women with more credit than had previously been given in his poem There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wisdom in Women which he published in 1914 & Other Poems.[33]",
            "Battle of Britain\nThe place of the Battle of Britain in British popular memory is due in no small part to the successful propaganda campaign waged by the Air Ministry, between July\u00e2\u20ac\u201cOctober 1940, but also in valorising the Few from March 1941 onwards. The publication of the immensely successful 3d pamphlet, The Battle of Britain, saw huge international sales, leading even Goebbels to admire its propaganda value. Focusing only upon the Few, with no mention of RAF bomber attacks against invasion barges, the Battle of Britain was soon established as a major victory for Fighter Command. This in turn inspired a wide range of feature films, books, magazines, works of art, poetry, radio plays and MOI short films.",
            "The River War\nAfter the Battle of Omdurman the Lancers were ordered to return to other duties so Churchill's personal experience of the war ceased at that point. Although Omdurman had been taken from Khalifa Abdullahi, the Khalifa himself escaped and was not captured for another year.[1]:41 The campaign included a number of persons who were to play important parts in the First World War. Aside from Churchill and Kitchener, captains Douglas Haig and Henry Rawlinson became generals in the war, while Lieutenant David Beatty, then commanding a Nile gunboat, became an admiral and commanded the British Grand Fleet.[1]:40",

The skills learned during the Blitz were again put to good use when the V1 and V2 rockets fell on London. Once again, the WVS played a key role in evacuation. With the success of D-Day, the WVS moved into Europe to support troops there. The first WVS abroad had landed in Italy with the success of the invasion there.",
            "Battle of Britain\nIt is notable that this most impressive of British victories had, in essence, been proclaimed within only five months of the cessation of large-scale daylight air battles, and without reference to Hitler and the OKW's reasoning for not proceeding with Operation Sea Lion. The continuing post-war popularity of the Battle of Britain is in fact directly attributable to the Air Ministry's latter-1940 air communiques, the media in turn broadcasting or publishing RAF aircraft claims. Noted above, this in turn led to the March 1941 pamphlet, which inspired a wide range of cultural responses to the Few, and the Battle of Britain. The Air Ministry built upon this with the development of the Battle of Britain Sunday commemoration, also supported the Battle of Britain clasp for issue to the Few in 1945, and from 1945 Battle of Britain Week. The Battle of Britain window in Westminster Abbey was also encouraged by the Air Ministry, Lords Trenchard and Dowding on its committee. By July 1947 when the window was unveiled, the Battle of Britain had already attained central prominence as Fighter Command's most notable victory, the Few alone credited with preventing invasion in 1940. Although given widespread media coverage in September and October 1940, RAF Bomber and Coastal Command raids against invasion barge concentrations had already been forgotten by war's end.",

            "(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover\nThe song was written about a year after British Commonwealth and German aircraft had been fighting over southern England, including the white cliffs of Dover, in the Battle of Britain. Nazi Germany had conquered much of Europe and in 1941 was still bombing Britain. With neither America nor the Soviet Union having yet joined the war, Britain was the only major power fighting the Axis powers in Europe (see The Darkest Hour). The American lyricist, Nat Burton, wrote his lyric unaware that the bluebird is not indigenous to Britain and asked Kent to set it to music.[1] Notable phrases include \"Thumbs Up!\" which was an RAF and RCAF term for permission to go, and \"flying in those angry skies\" where the air war was taking place."

After reading a newspaper story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd \"sacrificed\" herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the \"punishment\" was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further. When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived, that she loves him and there is something they must do as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it is, she replies, \"Fuck\".",

The book picks up the story with a death among the students and a spy on the loose threatening Call. The group is invited to a party in their honor, where two tragic incidents occur. First, Call is almost killed by a falling chandelier when he is invited to a room by Celia with a note, but it is not as it seems. A few minutes later, he sees Jennifer, the person who delivered the note, dead in the water. This throws the party into chaos, and everybody starts to evacuate. Call's dad takes the children to the Magisterium, where he believes they will be safe. Tamara and Aaron both believe that the spy, who they think tried to kill Call, is from the Magisterium, so they both keep an eye on Call 24/7. But that night, when Call comes to bed he is attacked by an elemental and almost killed if Aaron didn't step in and send the elemental to the void using his Makar or chaos powers. They started to investigate themselves, and wanted to go down to the prison where they held the elementals. But to do that, they would have to break into Anastasia Tarquin's room, Alex's stepmother. Upon entering Anastasia's room, they discover that the key they look for is hidden inside a voice-activated safe. After multiple faulty attempts, Call comes to a realization and enunciates the word that opens the safe: Jericho. Jericho is the mame of Constantine's twin brother, killed in an accident while they were students. Constantine was driven to find a method of \"curing death\" because of the loss of his brother. After retrieving the key, the trio enter it in the elemental gate, and as the gates disappear, they rush inside with a purpose. No information is retrieved from the elementals. Master Rufus surprises them by announcing that Alma, the leader of the Order of Disorder, will be teaching Aaron and Call. Aaron and Call make a deal with Alma to help her free the Chaos-ridden animals if she helps them communicate with the first victim, Jennifer. Later, Callum and Aaron help free the Chaos-ridden, assisted by Anastasia Tarquin and Alex Strike. Call passes out afteto a truck. When he wakes up, Aaron goes with him to visit Alma. Alma teaches them how to communicate with the dead. Callum interrogates Jennifer and finds out that she was killed by a \"boy she liked\" and Jennifer starts screaming for Kimiya to stay away. While trying to figure out more information, Callum accidentally raises her from the dead and Alma becomes suspicious of him. Call runs back to the hospital to find out that Tamara has left. They head back to their rooms when Alex rushes through the gates and alerts them that Tamara was kidnapped by the spy, and Havoc ran off into the woods surrounding the Magisterium. After running with Alex for a while, Call asks Alex to take off his hoodie. Upon seeing two blue stripes up his sleeve, (which Call recognises from a photograph of Constantane and Master Joseph) Call realizes that Alex is indeed the spy in the Magisterium, working for the Enemy of Death. Alex drags the pair to his hideout in the woods, and extracts the Chaos from Aaron's body using the Alkahest, killing him in the process. After subduing Call and Tamara, Alex escapes with wounds inflicted by Havoc. The masters arrive, and in Call's desperation rant about how he didn't do it, he mentions that he is the Enemy of Death, and the Masters \"clap him in chains\" He is taken to the Panopticon, the prison, and as the book ends, Anastasia Tarquin is at Call's cell door, telling him she shall free him, and that he is her \"son\" as she was Constantine's mother.",

It is structured differently, however, with the story being told through flashback. Shots when Raven's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint, with a darker, blue tint for those after her death. Whereas the motorcyclist dies before the first verse in the Dion version, Raven's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus. Meat Loaf becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending (some reviewers have compared this to the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut).[77]"

Following a third X Factor performance and heavy use in the Comic Relief 2010 television, it spent three more non-consecutive weeks in the top 10. In early 2011 the song returned to the top 40 again, at number 34, after it appeared in the 2011 series of Britain's Got Talent.",
            "You Make It Feel Like Christmas\nThe album's tracks were produced by busbee and Valentine.[8] Rachel McRady from Entertainment Tonight claimed that Stefani's holiday album contains \"old classics and new romantic odes, packed with plenty of Blake Shelton references\" alluding to her romantic life. Jon Pareles from The New York Times noted that the singer gives a \"luxury retro treatment\" to the album's twelve songs with the addition of \"horns, strings, backup singers\".[9]",
            "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\n\"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" was released as a single by Dee Dee Warwick on Mercury Records as the follow-up to her Top Ten R&B hit \"I Want to Be With You\"; co-writer Jerry Ross produced the track whose arrangement was by Jimmy Wisner while Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson provided background vocals.[1] This single - whose B-side is the earliest known recorded version of \"Yours Until Tomorrow\" by Gerry Goffin and Carole King - reached #13 R&B crossing over to #88 Pop in December 1966.",
            "I Can't Make You Love Me\nWhile reviewing her Live at the Royal Albert Hall DVD, critics lauded Adele's rendition. Andy Gill of The Independent called it an \"impassioned version,\"[42] while Alex Young of Consequence of Sound named it \"heartfelt and stunning.\"[43] Kit O'Toole of Blogcritics praised her rendition, writing that it \"retains its heart-wrenching, devastating mood thanks to Adele's multi-layered voice. Hearing her perform this song, one would imagine her as an older woman who has survived lifelong heartaches instead of a 23-year-old.\"[44] Maria Schurr of PopMatters lauded the covers (Raitt's \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" and Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love\") on the live album, naming \"the most successful,\" writing that \"both seem deeply heartfelt, like Adele understands, and is the only one who can make these words that are not hers ring true.\"[45] Chris Willman of The Wrap called it \"a classic of unrequited love that you'd have to swear she wrote if Bonnie Raitt hadn't turned it into the ultimate female weepie back when Adele was 2.\"[46]",
            "I'll Make a Man Out of You\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who were hired to write the songs for Mulan because, according to co-director Tony Bancroft, \"Disney was trying to find different songwriters that ... would give kind of different sound to each of the songs.\" While Zippel, a Broadway lyricist, was recruited because the directors were impressed by the songwriter's work on Disney's Hercules (1997), at the time Wilder, a pop singer and record producer, was best known for his hit single \"Break My Stride\".[1] Bancroft believes that, although the songwriters \"had two different sensibilities ... I think the[y] blend worked well together, especially on ['I'll Make a Man Out of You']\".[1]",
            "You Make It Feel Like Christmas (song)\n\"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\" runs for 2 minutes and 37 seconds.[7] Megan Armstrong from Billboard described the single as a mix of both \"Stefani's pop style\" and \"Shelton's country roots\", although she felt it emphasized the former rather than the latter.[9] A Christmas tune, the duet was described as \"an upbeat, old-timey, country-esque Yuletide song\" by Noisey's Alex Robert Ross.[10] In the chorus, Stefani and Shelton sing: \"Sleigh bells singing 'Hallelujah' / Stars are shining on us too / I want to thank you, baby / You make it feel like Christmas\".[5]",
            "The Way You Make Me Feel\nSince March 2009, Jackson was preparing to perform \"The Way You Make Me Feel'\" during his This Is It concert series from 2009 to 2010.[38] Following Jackson's death in June of the same year, video footage of Jackson rehearsing the song was featured in the 2009 concert documentary film, Michael Jackson's This Is It.[39] The video rehearsal footage was also featured on the films DVD in January 2010.[40]",
            "Save the Last Dance for Me\nIn the song, the narrator tells his lover she is free to mingle and socialize throughout the evening, but to make sure to save him the dance at the end of the night.[5] During an interview on Elvis Costello's show Spectacle, Lou Reed, who worked with Pomus, said the song was written on the day of Pomus' wedding while the wheelchair-bound groom watched his bride dancing with their guests. Pomus had polio and at times used crutches to get around.[6] His wife, Willi Burke, however, was a Broadway actress and dancer. The song gives his perspective of telling his wife to have fun dancing, but reminds her who will be taking her home and \"in whose arms you're gonna be.\"[7]",
            "You Make It Feel Like Christmas (song)\nRyan Reed of Rolling Stone said the Christmas song recalled \"the chug of The Supremes' 1966 hit 'You Can't Hurry Love'\" while the staff at Entertainment Weekly called the song infectious.[8][11] Mike Nied from Idolator suggested that Stefani and Shelton's track \"may have something that will live up to Mariah Carey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defining classic 'All I Want For Christmas Is You'\".[12]",
            "The Way You Make Me Feel\nIn 1989, German comedian Otto Waalkes parodies the music video in his film Otto \u2013 Der Au\u00dferfriesische.[41] In 2003, the music group Shakaya covered \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and released their version as a non-album single. The song only charted on Australian charts, peaking at number 21 on the country's music charts.[42] In December 2009, Stacey Solomon, a contestant on the X Factor in the United Kingdom, performed a cover of the song during the show's semi-finals, which received mixed opinions from the show's judges.[43][44] In January 2010, Nick Jonas performed the song during a concert at the Warner Theatre.[45] In February 2010, Whitney Houston performed \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", along with Jackson's \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", during her I Look to You Tour.[46][47] In October 2016, Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez and Dancing with the Stars pro dancer Valentin Chmerkovskiy, the eventual winners of the 23rd season, performed a jazz routine dance to the song during the reality dance competition's Cirque du Soleil-themed episode.[48]",
            "Made in the USA (song)\nThe patriotic love song[2] was composed by Corey Chorus, Lovato, Jason Evigan, Jonas Jeberg and Blair Perkins.[5] It was written in 2011, originally intended for R&B artist Blair Perkins, though after producer Mio Vukovic heard it, he knew it was \"meant\" for Lovato. Songwriter and producer Jason Evigan told MTV News that the song was \"Demi-fied\" in response, though still contains an \"R&B feel\", explaining: \"[Now] it's got like a country vibe mixed with this R&B feel, which makes it kind of pop country thing.\" Lovato reacted to the track instantly, and made a few changes to it. Lyrically, Made In The USA is inspired by \"American romantic love stories\" in the 1930s.[4]",
            "Love Me with All Your Heart\nThe song was made famous first with Spanish lyrics written by the Los Hermanos Rigual (Carlos Rigual and Mario Rigual). The English lyrics are sometimes credited to Michael Vaughn (or Maurice Vaughn) and sometimes to Sunny Skylar.[3] The song was published in 1961. Although both the Spanish and the English versions are love songs, the lyrics are not translations of each other. The Spanish title translates as \"When the sun heats (or warms) up\". A version recorded by The Ray Charles Singers went to number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent four weeks at number one on the Pop-Standard singles chart in June 1964.[4] Karl Denvers version also charted in the UK in 1964.",
            "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\nCarole King and Gloria Estefan performed the song in May 2009 in the She's Got a Friend concerts at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. The audio from one of the performances was included on some editions of Estefan's 2013 album, The Standards.",
            "You Make Me Feel So Young\nIn 1951, \"You Make Me Feel So Young\" served as the title song for the social comedy As Young as You Feel, starring Monty Woolley, Thelma Ritter, David Wayne, Jean Peters, and Marilyn Monroe.[citation needed]",
            "The Way You Make Me Feel\nThe introduction of the full version of the video also samples the Roy Ayers 1985 song \"Hot\" (written by Binky Brice, Philip Hunter Field and James Mtume)[34] from his You Might Be Surprised album.",

            "The Way You Make Me Feel\n\"The Way You Make Me Feel\" generally received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine listed \"The Way You May Me Feel\" as well as the album's title track, \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" and \"Man In The Mirror\" as being a 'track picks' from Bad.[9] Erlewine commented that out of all of Bad's songs, \"only three can stand alongside album tracks from its predecessor\" which were \"Bad\", \"The Way You Make Me Feel,\" and \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\".[9] Jon Pareles, a writer for The New York Times, commented that Jackson's songs, \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"say nothing more personalized than their titles\".[10]"

Some parts of Europe call roman \"antiqua\" from its connection with the humanistic \"lettera antica\"; \"medieval\" and \"old-style\" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by Aldus Manutius (Italian: Manuzio).

Jenson's design and the very similar roman types cut by Francesco Griffo c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and archetypal roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed.",
            "History of Western typography\nThe early printers of Spain were Germans who began by printing in up-to-date roman types but soon gave these up and adopted Gothic typefaces based on the letterforms of Spanish manuscripts. Valencia in the Kingdom of Aragon was the location of the first press, established in 1473. From there printers moved to other cities to set up presses. Roman types were used by the printers of Salamanca for their editions of classical authors. Printing in Portuguese began at Lisbon in 1495 (the first book printed in Portugal was a Hebrew book printed in 1489),[1]",
            "History of Western typography\nAfter their 1494 invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture, and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo-classical. The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late 1520s. At the end of this period roman types introduced by Robert Estienne, Simon de Colines and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character. Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne, who had died in 1520. Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne's assistant, married his widow, and set up his own press.",
            "History of Western typography\nThe classically endowed city of Rome attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany, Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim, closely followed by the brothers Johann and Wendelin of Speyer (de Spira), and the Frenchman Nicolas Jenson. The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty; all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing, and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to Venice.",
            "Roman type\nDuring the early Renaissance, roman (in the form of Antiqua) and italic type were used separately. Today, roman and italic type are mixed, and most typefaces are composed of an upright roman style with an associated italic or oblique style.",
            "History of Western typography\nSoon after 1500, roman typefaces began to gain popularity north of the Alps for printing of Latin literature. Johann Froben of Basel, Switzerland set up his press in 1491, and by about 1519 (when he printed Erasmus's famous edition of the Greek New Testament) he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German-speaking world and also in Spain and, to a lesser extent in England. His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized; it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials (often designed by distinguished artists) and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFroben was the first to use such 'display faces' consistently, breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text. By using these large faces, Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole. Froben's italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect. These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique.",

            "History of Western typography\nIn Italy the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by Venetian or \"old style\" Latin types, also called antiqua. The inscriptional capitals on Roman buildings and monuments were structured on a euclidean geometric scheme and the discrete component-based model of classical architecture. Their structurally perfect design, near-perfect execution in stone, balanced angled stressing, contrasting thick and thin strokes, and incised serifs became the typographic ideal for western civilization. The best-known example of Roman inscriptional capitals exists on the base of Trajan's Column, inscribed c. 113.",
            "Typography\nThe development of Roman typeface can be traced back to Greek lapidary letters. Greek lapidary letters were carved into stone and \"one of the first formal uses of Western letterforms\"; after that, Roman lapidary letterforms evolved into the monumental capitals, which laid the foundation for Western typographical design, especially serif typefaces.[33]:10 There are two styles of Roman typefaces: the old style, and the modern. The former is characterized by its similarly weighted lines, while the latter is distinguished by its contrast of light and heavy lines.[31] Often, these styles are combined.",
            "Times New Roman\nBecause of its popularity, the typeface has been influential in the subsequent development of a number of serif typefaces both before and after the start of the digital-font era.",
            "History of Western typography\nThe svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best-known figure of French typography\u2014Claude Garamond (also Garamont). In 1541 Robert Estienne, printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King Francis I of France, known as the \"grecs du roi\". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch-cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, Christoffel Plantijn and the printer Andr\u00e9 Wechel, the types known as \"Canon de Garamond\" and \"Petit Canon de Garamond\" shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as Claude Garamond's final roman types.",
            "Ancient Roman architecture\nInscriptions on Roman triumphal arches were works of art in themselves, with very finely cut, sometimes gilded letters. The form of each letter and the spacing between them was carefully designed for maximum clarity and simplicity, without any decorative flourishes, emphasizing the Roman taste for restraint and order. This conception of what later became the art of typography remains of fundamental importance down to the present day.[79]",
            "History of Western typography\nThe humanist spirit driving the Renaissance produced its own unique style of formal writing, known as \"cursiva humanistica\". This slanted and rapidly written letter evolved from humanistic minuscule and the remaining Gothic current cursive hands in Italy, served as the model for cursive or italic typefaces. As books printed with early roman types forced humanistic minuscule out of use, cursiva humanistica gained favor as a manuscript hand for the purpose of writing. The popularity of cursive writing itself may have created some demand for a type of this style. The more decisive catalyst was probably the printing of pocket editions of Latin classics by Aldus Manutius.",
            "History of Western typography\nThe Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful abstract stylization. The carefully modelled serifs follow an artful logic of asymmetry. The ratio of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious body of type. Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic \"white space\") with figures (letters) to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic.",
            "History of Western typography\nTrue modern romans arrived with the types of the Italian Giambattista Bodoni and the French Didots. Completing trends begun by the Fell types, Fleischman, Fournier and Baskerville, the so-called \"classical\" modern romans eschewed chirographic and organic influences, their synthetic symmetric geometry answering to a rationalized and reformed classical model driven by the strict cartesian grid philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and the predictable clockwork universe of Isaac Newton.",
            "History of Western typography\nRobert Granjon worked in the second half of the 16th century, mainly at Lyon, but was also recorded at Paris, Rome and Antwerp. He is still famous because of his Civilit\u00e9 types, imitating French gothic cursive calligraphy. His main contribution was an italic type known as \"Parangon de Granjon\". Italic type design had apparently become corrupted since the Arrighi and Aldine models. Granjon's italic had a greater slant angle, slanted roman capitals, and reduced weight and rigor. These qualities and its contrasting thick and thin strokes gave it a dazzling appearance that made it difficult to read. It was nevertheless the main influence for italic type design until the Arrighi model was revived in 1920.",
            "History of Western typography\nIn Britain and the United States, modern romans (emerging around 1800 and totally dominant by the 1820s) took a somewhat more rounded, less geometrical form than the designs of Didot and Bodoni; an obvious difference is that in Anglo-American faces the upper-case C has only one serif (at the top) whereas in European designs it has two.",
            "History of Western typography\nThe \"Aldino\" italic type, commissioned by Manutius and cut by Franceso Griffo in 1499, was a closely spaced condensed type. Griffo's punches are a delicate translation of the Italian cursive hand, featuring letters of irregular slant angle and uneven height and vertical position, with some connected pairs (ligatures), and unslanted small roman capitals the height of the lower case t. The fame of Aldus Manutius and his editions made the Griffo italic widely copied and influential, although it was not the finest of the pioneer italics. The \"Aldino\" style quickly became known as \"italic\" from its Italian origin.",

            "Sans-serif\nThe earliest printing typefaces which omitted serifs were not intended to render contemporary texts, but to represent inscriptions in Ancient Greek and Etruscan. Thus, Thomas Dempster's De Etruria regali libri VII (1723), used special types intended for the representation of  Etruscan epigraphy, and in c. 1745, the Caslon foundry made Etruscan types for pamphlets written by Etruscan scholar John Swinton.[39] Another niche used of a printed sans-serif letterform from in 1786 onwards was a rounded sans-serif script font developed by Valentin Ha\u00fcy for the use of the blind to read with their fingers.[40][41][42]",
            "History of the Latin script\nWith the spread of printing, several styles of Latin typography emerged with fonts based on various minuscules of the Middle Ages depending on the region. In Germany, starting with Johannes Gutenberg the commonly used typefaces were based on blackletter scripts, a tradition that lasted until the 20th century, an example of the later typefaces used is fraktur.\nIn Italy due to the revival of classical culture the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by Venetian Latin types, also called antiqua, which were based on the inscriptional capitals on Roman buildings and monuments. However, humanist scholars of the early 15th century mistook Carolingian minuscule as the authentic writing style of the Romans and redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time moveable type reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as humanistic minuscule, which served as the basis for Venetian typeface.",
            "Typography\nIn the nascent stages of European printing, the typeface (blackletter, or Gothic) was designed in imitation of the popular hand-lettering styles of scribes.[31] Initially, this typeface was difficult to read, because each letter was set in place individually and made to fit tightly into the allocated space.[32] The art of manuscript writing, whose origin was during Hellenistic and Roman bookmaking, reached its zenith in the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages. Metal typefaces notably altered the style, making it \"crisp and uncompromising\", and also brought about \"new standards of composition\".[30]\nDuring the Renaissance period in France, Claude Garamond was partially responsible for the adoption of Roman typeface that eventually supplanted the more commonly used Gothic (blackletter).[33]:8 Roman typeface also was based on hand-lettering styles.[34]",
            "Johnston (typeface)\nThe capitals of the typeface are based on Roman square capitals such as those on the Column of Trajan, and the lower-case on traditional serif fonts. Johnston greatly admired Roman capitals, writing that they \"held the supreme place among letters for readableness and beauty. They are the best forms for the grandest and most important inscriptions.\"[6] Justin Howes, author of the leading work on the Johnston Sans design, Johnston's Underground Type, has highlighted the similarity of the design to the eighteenth-century Caslon type designed by William Caslon in particular, noting that Johnston had worked on a book printed using this typeface shortly before starting work on his design and reproduced their structure in a textbook.[7]",
            "History of Western typography\nSurviving examples of 16th-century Italian books indicate the bulk of them were printed with italic types. By mid-century the popularity of italic types for sustained text setting began to decline until they were used only for in-line citations, block quotes, preliminary text, emphasis, and abbreviations. Italic types from the 20th century up to the present are much indebted to Arrighi and his influence on French designers.",
            "History of Western typography\nThe \"classical\" appellation of modern romans stems from their return to long ascenders and descenders set on widely spaced lines, and a corresponding light page effect reminiscent of old-style\u00e2\u20ac\u201doccurring at a time of classical revival.",

            "History of Western typography\nSome time before 1472 in Venice, Johann and Wendelin issued material printed with a half-Gothic-half-roman type known as \"Gotico-antiqua\". This design paired simplified Gothic capitals with a rationalized humanistic minuscule letter set, itself combining Gothic minuscule forms with elements of Carolingian, in a one step forward, half step back blending of styles.",
            "History of Western typography\nEspecially the New Book Art movement, which formed in the decade before World War I, was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. The young type designers of the pre-war era, among them Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke and Friedrich Wilhelm Kleukens, rejected both the late typographical classicism and the ornaments of the popular Art nouveau. The new ideal became a tidy and straightforward book typography, which dedicated itself to the ideas of the Renaissance. Walter Tiemann in Leipzig, Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler in Stuttgart, and Rudolf Koch in Offenbach as instructors were the mentors of this kind of typography. They stayed influential in the field of book typesetting until a long time after the end of World War II.",
            "Roman type\nEarly roman typefaces show a variety of designs, for instance characters resembling what would now be considered blackletter.[5][6][7] Printers and typefounders such as Nicolas Jenson and Aldus Manutius in Venice and later Robert Estienne in France codified the modern characteristics of Roman type, for instance an 'h' with a nearly straight right leg, serifs on the outside of the capital 'M' and 'N', and 'e' with level cross stroke, by the 1530s.[8][9]",
            "History of Western typography\nBodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style. He produced an italic very close to Baskerville's, and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts. The roman types of Francois Ambroise Didot and son Firmin Didot closely resemble the work of Bodoni, and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans. At any rate the Didots' mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the \"enlightenment\" of post-revolution France under Napoleon. Francois Ambroise also designed \"maigre\" and \"gras\" types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats.",

In England modern romans resembling Bodoni's were cut for the printer William Bulmer c. 1786 by the punchcutter William Martin, who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him. Martin's italic mirrored the open-tail g and overall finesse of Baskerville's.",
            "Julius Caesar\nUsing the Latin alphabet of the period, which lacked the letters J and U, Caesar's name would be rendered GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR; the form CAIVS is also attested, using the older Roman representation of G by C. The standard abbreviation was C.\u00a0IVLIVS C\u00c6SAR, reflecting the older spelling. (The letterform \u00c6 is a ligature of the letters A and E, and is often used in Latin inscriptions to save space.)",
            "Printing press\nHaving previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions,[34] a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.[35]",
            "History of Western typography\nTypography, type-founding and typeface design began as closely related crafts in mid-15th-century Europe with the introduction of movable type printing at the junction of the medieval era and the Renaissance. Handwritten letterforms of the mid-15th century embodied 3000\u00c2\u00a0years of evolved letter design, and were the natural models for letterforms in systematized typography. The scribal letter known as textur or textualis, produced by the strong gothic spirit of blackletter from the hands of German area scribes, served as the model for the first text types.",

The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called Mrs Eaves, is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves.[7]",

Caslon established a tradition of engraving type in London, which previously had not been common, and so he was influenced by the imported Dutch Baroque typefaces that were popular in England at the time.[4][5][6][7] His typefaces established a strong reputation for their quality and their attractive appearance, suitable for extended passages of text.[8][9]",

Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly bracketed serifs and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm\u2014its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however.

Though some argument exists as to whether Transitional fonts exist as a discrete category among serif fonts, Transitional fonts lie somewhere between Old Style and Modern style typefaces. Transitional fonts exhibit a marked increase in the variation of stroke weight and a more horizontal serif compared to Old Style.

The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high x-height, short descenders to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance. The new design made its debut in The Times on 3 October 1932.[13][14] After one year, the design was released for commercial sale.[15] Although Morison may not have literally drawn the design, his influence on its concept was sufficient that he felt that he could take credit for it as \"my one effort at designing a font\".[16][d] In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular style of a conventional serif font, or what is called its roman, the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed.[17] (The style is called Antiqua in some countries.)

Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the 15th century, when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs. Jodocus Badius Ascensius (Josse Bade) in partnership with Henri Estienne established a press in Paris in 1503.

French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers, and Lyon and Paris became the new centers of activity. Eventually, the French government fixed a standard height for all type, to ensure that different batches could be used together.[3]"

            "There's a Hole in My Bucket\nIn later German sources the song is reproduced under the title of Heinrich und Liese and credited as a folk song from Hesse. In the 19th century it was sung as a commercium song and printed in the 1858 Kommersbuch. The renowned song collection Deutscher Liederhort (3 volumes, 1856\u20131894) edited by Ludwig Erk and Franz Magnus B\u00f6hme includes the song, relating it also to the Flemish song Mooy Bernardyn (\"Wat doet gy in het groene veld\u00a0?\"). The German song became even more widespread when it was included in the famous Wandervogel songbook Der Zupfgeigenhansl in 1909.",
            "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\nWilliams likely first heard \"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\" from Rufus Payne, nicknamed \"Tee Tot,\" a black street singer who taught a young Hank to play blues guitar.[6] In the essay to the 1990 Polygram box set Hank Williams: The Original Singles Collection, Colin Escott quotes Williams in an interview with Ralph Gleason in 1952: \"I was shinin' shoes and sellin' newspapers and following this old Nigrah around to get him to teach me how to play the git-tar. I'd give him 15 cents or whatever I could get ahold of for a lesson.\" Understandably, producer Fred Rose was wary of the song's commercial potential; as country music historian Escott notes, \"Fred Rose's opposition to the song had a lot to do with the fact that it mentioned beer, and probably had something to do with the fact that Acuff-Rose didn't publish it.\" In addition, Williams originally had a couplet mentioning a Ford automobile (\"Me an' my baby, we got a Ford/Now we change the gears from the running board\") and Rose demanded that, if Williams did record it, the reference be dropped because if Hank endorsed Ford, \"then deejays sponsored by GM, Chrysler, and Studebaker wouldn't spin his record.\"[7] Williams recorded the song on August 30, 1949 at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio (the same session that produced the B-side \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\").

This version predates the C. Williams copyright. The original melody evolved from the second theme of \"Long Lost Blues\" published in 1914 by J. Paul Wyer and H. Alf Kelley. The \"Long Lost Blues\" theme was a variation of \"Bucket's Got a Hole in It\", a motif that appears in several versions of \"Keep A-Knockin\". This tune later became the basis for several versions of the song, \"You Can't Come In\" recorded by multiple artists. However, \"Bucket's Got a Hole in It\" has also been attributed to Buddy Bolden, which would date it before 1906.[2] As one critic noted, Hank Williams \"could have been given this ditty to record, [but] he may have been familiar with this ditty from previous recordings or had heard it while growing up in Alabama.\"[3]",

Melrose brought together a small group of artists from St. Louis, and some of Chicago\u2019s finest blues artists of the time, and over the course of the next 20 months, recorded over 300 tracks.[5] \" Featured in this series of recordings are the performers Tampa Red, Washboard Sam, Big Bill Broonzy, Walter Davis, John Lee \u201cSonny Boy\u201d Williamson, Big Joe Williams, Henry Townsend, Robert Lee McCoy, Speckled Red, Merlene Johnson, Addie \u201cSweet Peas\u201d Spivey, Bill \u201cJazz\u201d Gillum and One Arm Slim, amongst many others.[5]",

            "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\nRemarkably, the song was released as the B-side to the blues \"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\" because up-tempo numbers were deemed more appropriate for the jukebox trade than melancholy ballads.  The single reached No. 4 on the country chart in 1949.[5]  The song has become closely identified with Williams' legend and musical legacy and has been widely praised.  In the 2003 documentary The Road to Nashville, singer k.d. lang states, \"I think 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' is one of the most classic American songs ever written, truly.  Beautiful song.\"  In his autobiography, Bob Dylan recalls, \"Even at a young age, I identified with him.  I didn't have to experience anything that Hank did to know what he was singing about.  I'd never heard a robin weep, but could imagine it and it made me sad.\"[6]  In its online biography of the singer, Rolling Stone notes, \"In tracks like 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' Williams expressed intense, personal emotions with country's traditional plainspoken directness, a then-revolutionary approach that has come to define the genre through the works of subsequent artists from George Jones and Willie Nelson to Gram Parsons and Dwight Yoakam.\"  Rolling Stone ranked it No. 111 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the oldest song on the list, and No. 3 on its 100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time.",

            "Hank Williams\nHe taught Williams chords, chord progressions, bass turns, and the musical style of accompaniment that he would use in most of his future songwriting. Later on, Williams recorded one of the songs that Payne taught him, \"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\".[23] Williams musical style contained influences from Payne along with several other country influences, among them \"the Singing Brakeman\" Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, and Roy Acuff.[24] In 1937 Williams got into a fight with his physical education coach about exercises the coach wanted him to do. His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama. Payne and Williams lost touch, though eventually, Payne also moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939. Williams later credited him as his only teacher.[25]",
            "I Always Get Lucky with You\nCo-writer Merle Haggard recorded the song first on his 1981 hit LP Big City but did not release it as a single. According to the Stephen L. Betts Rolling Stone article \"George Jones Gets 'Lucky' with Merle Haggard Song\" published online on February 13, 2015, Haggard's manager Tex Whitson first pitched it to Jones' producer Billy Sherrill because Jones and Haggard were on the outs at the time. \"I'd get mad at him over the years because of his self-damage, but everything I said to him was out of love,\" Haggard wrote in an article for Rolling Stone after his friend died. \"Imagine you're George Jones, and every night you're expected to sing as good as you did on a song like 'She Thinks I Still Care.' He was a shy country boy from East Texas walking around with that on his shoulders. He knew people expected him to be the greatest country singer that ever lived. He was the Babe Ruth of country music, and people expected a home run every time.\" Sherrill, who had produced Jones and Haggard on their first duet album together A Taste of Yesterday's Wine the year before, still possessed his instincts for a great song and persuaded Jones to cut it. In the 1994 video retrospective Golden Hits, Jones recalled that he \"sung it around Nashville at some of the clubs to try and get used to it before I went into the studio and it came off great. It's a great song. Merle Haggard wrote a good one there.\" Jones, who was about to hit rock bottom after spending most of the previous decade in a booze and drug-crazed wasteland, delivered a sterling performance, which became the last chart topper of his career, ironically bumping off \"Pancho and Lefty,\" Haggard's hit duet with Willie Nelson. Haggard would record the song again in 2006 as part of the second Jones/Haggard release Kickin' Out the Footlights...Again.

            "Mac Davis\nOne of the songs he wrote in 1968, called \"A Little Less Conversation\", was recorded by Elvis Presley (and would become a posthumous success for Presley years later). Shortly after, Presley recorded Davis' song \"In the Ghetto\" in his sessions in Memphis. According to maverick record producer Jimmy Bowen, \"Ghetto\" was originally pitched to Sammy Davis, Jr. Mac, guitar in hand, played the song in a studio, with onlookers such as Rev. Jesse Jackson and other members of the black activist community. Davis, the only Caucasian man in the room at the time, eventually told Bowen, \"I don't know whether to thank ya, or to kill ya.\" Davis eventually recorded the tune after Presley's version became a success, and was released in a Ronco In Concert compilation in 1975. It was later released on a campy Rhino Records Golden Throats compilation in 1991. The song became a success for Presley and he continued to record more of Davis' material, such as \"Memories\" , \"Don't Cry Daddy\" and \"Clean Up Your Own Backyard\". Bobby Goldsboro also recorded some of Davis's songs, including \"Watching Scotty Grow\", which became a number one Adult Contemporary success for Goldsboro in 1971. Other artists who recorded his material included Vikki Carr, O.C. Smith, and Kenny Rogers and The First Edition. \"I Believe in Music\", often considered to be Davis's signature song, was recorded by several artists (including Marian Love, B.J. Thomas, Louis Jordan, Perry Como, Helen Reddy, and Davis himself) before it finally became a success in 1972 for the group Gallery.",

            "Roman emperor\nBefore the beginning of the siege, Mehmed the Conqueror made an offer to Constantine XI. In exchange for the surrender of Constantinople, the emperor's life would be spared and he would continue to rule in Mystra. Constantine refused this offer. Instead he led the defense of the city and took an active part in the fighting along the land walls. At the same time, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain the necessary unity between the Genovese, Venetian, and Byzantine troops. As the city fell on May 29, 1453, Constantine is said to have remarked: \"The city is fallen but I am alive.\" Realizing that the end had come, he reportedly discarded his purple cloak and led his remaining soldiers into a final charge, in which he was killed. With his death, Roman imperial succession came to an end, almost 1500 years after Augustus.",
            "History of Rome\nIn the following years, Rome continued its conquests in Spain with Tiberius Gracchus, and it set foot in Asia, when the last king of Pergamum gave his kingdom to the Roman people. The end of the 2nd century brought another threat, when a great host of Germanic peoples, namely Cimbri and Teutones, crossed the river Rhone and moved to Italy. Gaius Marius was consul five consecutive times (seven total), and won two decisive battles in 102 and 101\u00c2\u00a0BC He also reformed the Roman army, giving it such a good reorganization that it remained unchanged for centuries.",
            "North Africa\nNorth Africa remained a part of the Roman Empire, which produced many notable citizens such as Augustine of Hippo, until incompetent leadership from Roman commanders in the early fifth century allowed the Germanic peoples, the Vandals, to cross the Strait of Gibraltar, whereupon they overcame the fickle Roman defense. The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the Huns. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the Western Roman Empire. The last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the Heruli general Odoacer. Trade routes between Europe and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam. Some Berbers were members of the Early African Church (but evolved their own Donatist doctrine),[16] some were Berber Jews, and some adhered to traditional Berber religion. African pope Victor I served during the reign of Roman emperor Septimius Severus",
            "Byzantine army\nThe emperor was struck twice by the Turk troops, the mortal blow being a knife to his back. There, on the walls of Constantinople, alone and abandoned by his remaining troops, the emperor died. The fall of the Byzantine capital meant the end of the Roman empire. The Byzantine army, the last surviving direct descendant of the Roman legions, was finished.",
            "Fall of the Western Roman Empire\nThe remaining troops in Britannia elevated a succession of imperial usurpers. The last, Constantine III, raised an army from the remaining troops in Britannia, invaded Gaul and defeated forces loyal to Honorius led by Sarus. Constantine's power reached its peak in 409 when he controlled Gaul and beyond, he was joint consul with Honorius[142] and his magister militum Gerontius defeated the last Roman force to try to hold the borders of Hispania. It was led by relatives of Honorius; Constantine executed them. Gerontius went to Hispania where he may have settled the Sueves and the Asding Vandals. Gerontius then fell out with his master and elevated one Maximus as his own puppet emperor. He defeated Constantine and was besieging him in Arelate when Honorius's general Constantius arrived from Italy with an army (possibly, mainly of Hun mercenaries).[143] Gerontius's troops deserted him and he committed suicide. Constantius continued the siege, defeating a relieving army. Constantine surrendered in 411 with a promise that his life would be spared, and was executed.[144]",
            "History of Europe\nIn 395 Theodosius I, who had made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, would be the last emperor to preside over a united Roman Empire. The empire was split into two halves: the Western Roman Empire centred in Ravenna, and the Eastern Roman Empire (later to be referred to as the Byzantine Empire) centred in Constantinople. The Western Roman Empire was repeatedly attacked by Germanic tribes (see: Migration Period), and in 476 finally fell to the Heruli chieftain Odoacer.",
            "Legacy of the Roman Empire\nAfter the fall of Constantinople, Thomas Palaiologos, brother of the last Eastern Roman Emperor, Constantine XI, was elected emperor and tried to organize the remaining forces. His rule came to an end after the fall of the last major Byzantine city, Corinth. He then moved to Italy and continued to be recognized as Eastern emperor by the Christian powers.",
            "History of Europe\nSome other notable dates are the Battle of Adrianople in 378, the death of Theodosius I in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the Rhine in 406 by Germanic tribes after the withdrawal of the legions to defend Italy against Alaric I, the death of Stilicho in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western legions, the death of Justinian I, the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632. Many scholars maintain that rather than a \"fall\", the changes can more accurately be described as a complex transformation.[16] Over time many theories have been proposed on why the Empire fell, or whether indeed it fell at all.",
            "Romulus Augustulus\nAs the last Western Roman emperor before the traditionally agreed-upon end of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus has been portrayed several times in film and literature; the play Romulus the Great (1950), by Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, focuses on the reign of \"Romulus Augustus\" and the end of the Roman Empire in the West. The 2007 film The Last Legion, and the novel on which it is based, includes a heavily fictionalized account of the reign and subsequent life of Romulus Augustus; escaping captivity with the aid of a small band of loyal Romans, he reaches Britain, where he eventually becomes Uther Pendragon.",
            "Celts\nThe defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.",
            "Croatia\nDuring the 5th century, the last de jure Western emperor last Western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos ruled his small realm from the palace after fleeing Italy to go into exile in 475.[21] He was assassinated in 480. The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the first half of the 7th century and destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands and mountains. The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.[22]",
            "Roman emperor\nThe Western Roman Empire collapsed in the late 5th century. Romulus Augustulus is often considered to be the last emperor of the west after his forced abdication in 476, although Julius Nepos maintained a claim to the title until his death in 480. Meanwhile, in the east, emperors continued to rule from Constantinople (\"New Rome\"); these are referred to in modern scholarship as \"Byzantine emperor\" but they used no such title and called themselves \"Emperor of the Romans\" (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd).

            "Byzantine army\nDuring the beginning of the 6th century, several barbarian tribes who eventually destroyed the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century eventually were recruited in the armies of the Eastern Roman Empire. Among them were the Heruli, who had deposed the last Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus under their leader Odoacer in 476. Other barbarians included the Huns, who had invaded the divided Roman Empire during the second quarter of the 5th century under Attila, and the Gepids, who had settled in the Romanian territories north of the Danube River.",
            "Western Roman Empire\nRemaining as emperor after the death of Stilicho in 408, Honorius reigned until his own death in 423. His reign was filled with usurpations and invasions. In 410, Rome was sacked by Alaric's forces. This event made a great impression on contemporaries, as this was the first time since the Gallic invasions of the 4th century BC that the city had fallen to a foreign enemy. Under Alaric's successors, the Goths then settled in Gaul (412\u2013418), from where they operated as Roman allies against the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi in Spain, and against the usurper Jovinus (413). Meanwhile, another usurper, Constantine (406\u2013411), had stripped Roman Britain of its defenses when he crossed over to Gaul in 407, leaving the Romanized population subject to invasions, first by the Picts and then by the Saxons, Angli, and the Jutes who began to settle permanently from about 440 onwards.",
            "The Last Legion\nOrestes, who was partly of Germanic blood, was historically the magister militum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the senior officer of the Roman army second to the emperor. He had indeed promised his Germanic foederati a third of Italy to settle in but not to Odoacer personally. Orestes was himself a usurper, having promised the land to foederati to buy their quiescence in his rebellion against the legitimate emperor Julius Nepos. Although Orestes proclaimed his son, Romulus Augustus (derisively called Augustulus, meaning \"little Augustus\") Emperor, the proclamation was not recognised as legitimate beyond the parts of the Italian Peninsula controlled by Orestes' troops. The common identification of Augustus as the \"last Western Emperor\" dates only from the publication of British historian Edward Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in the late 18th Century.",
            "History of the Roman Empire\nThe Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century as Germanic migrations and invasions overwhelmed the capacity of the Empire to assimilate the migrants and fight off the invaders. The Romans were successful in fighting off all invaders,[citation needed] most famously Attila the Hun, though the Empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the Empire started to dismember itself. Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer.[13] By placing himself under the rule of the Eastern Emperor, rather than naming himself Emperor as other Germanic chiefs had done, Odoacer ended the Western Empire by ending the line of Western Emperors. The eastern Empire exercised diminishing control over the west over the course of the next century. The empire in the East\u2014known today as the Byzantine Empire, but referred to in its time as the \"Roman Empire\" or by various other names\u2014ended in 1453 with the death of Constantine\u00a0XI and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks.[14]",
            "History of Europe\nThe Roman Empire had been repeatedly attacked by invading armies from Northern Europe and in 476, Rome finally fell. Romulus Augustus, the last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, surrendered to the Germanic King Odoacer. The British historian Edward Gibbon argued in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776) that the Romans had become decadent, they had lost civic virtue.",
            "Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire\nThroughout the 5th century, Western emperors were usually figureheads, while the Eastern emperors maintained more independence. For most of the time, the actual rulers in the West were military strongmen who took the titles of magister militum, patrician, or both, such as Stilicho, Aetius, and Ricimer. Although Rome was no longer the capital in the West, it remained the West's largest city and its economic center. But the city was sacked by rebellious Visigoths in 410 and by the Vandals in 455, events that shocked contemporaries and signaled the disintegration of Roman authority. Saint Augustine wrote The City of God partly as an answer to critics who blamed the sack of Rome by the Visigoths on the abandonment of the traditional pagan religions.",
            "Ostrogothic Kingdom\nIn Italy the Ostrogoths, led by Theoderic the Great, killed and replaced Odoacer, a Germanic soldier, erstwhile-leader of the foederati in Northern Italy, and the de facto ruler of Italy, who had deposed the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus Augustulus, in 476. Under Theoderic, its first king, the Ostrogothic kingdom reached its zenith, stretching from modern France in the west into modern Serbia in the southeast. Most of the social institutions of the late Western Roman Empire were preserved during his rule. Theodoric called himself Gothorum Romanorumque rex (\"King of the Goths and Romans\"), demonstrating his desire to be a leader for both peoples.",
            "Italy in the Middle Ages\nItaly was invaded by the Visigoths in the 5th century, and Rome was sacked by Alaric in 410. The (traditional) last Western Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustus, was deposed in 476 by an Eastern Germanic general, Odoacer. He subsequently ruled in Italy for seventeen years as rex gentium, theoretically under the suzerainty of the eastern Roman emperor Zeno, but practically in total independence. The administration remained essentially the same as that under the Western Roman Empire, and gave religious freedoms to the Christians. Odoacer fought against the Vandals, who had occupied Sicily, and other Germanic tribes that periodically invaded the peninsula.",
            "Goths\nAfter Gallienus was assassinated outside Milan in the summer of 268 in a plot led by high officers in his army, Claudius Gothicus was proclaimed emperor and headed to Rome to establish his rule. Claudius' immediate concerns were with the Alamanni, who had invaded Raetia and Italy. After he defeated them in the Battle of Lake Benacus, he was finally able to take care of the invasions in the Balkan provinces.[21] Learning of the approach of Claudius, the Goths first attempted to directly invade Italy.[22] They were engaged at the Battle of Naissus. It seems that Aurelian, who was in charge of all Roman cavalry during Claudius' reign, led the decisive attack in the battle. Some survivors were resettled within the empire, while others were incorporated into the Roman army. The battle ensured the survival of the Roman Empire for another two centuries. In 270, after the death of Claudius, Goths under the leadership of Cannabaudes again launched an invasion on the Roman Empire, but were defeated by Aurelian, who however surrendered Dacia beyond the Danube.",
            "Western Roman Empire\nThe instability caused by usurpers throughout the Western Empire helped these tribes in their conquests, and by the 450s the Germanic tribes had become usurpers themselves. During the next twenty years, several Western Emperors were installed by Constantinople, but their authority relied upon barbarian commanders (Ricimer (456\u2013472), Gundobad (473\u2013475)).

Finally, when the Romans perceived that Hannibal's supplies were running out, they sent Scipio, who had defeated Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal in Spain, to invade the unprotected Carthaginian hinterland and force Hannibal to return to defend Carthage itself. The result was the ending of the Second Punic War by the famously decisive Battle of Zama in October 202\u00c2\u00a0BC, which gave to Scipio his agnomen Africanus.

This inevitably weakened the army and the society upon which it depended, making it less able to defend itself against the growing numbers of Rome's enemies. The army still remained a superior fighting instrument to its opponents, both civilized and barbarian; this is shown in the victories over Germanic tribes at the Battle of Strasbourg (357) and in its ability to hold the line against the Sassanid Persians throughout the 4th century. But, says Goldsworthy, \"Weakening central authority, social and economic problems and, most of all, the continuing grind of civil wars eroded the political capacity to maintain the army at this level.\"[12] Goldsworthy set out in greater detail his theory that recurring civil wars during the late fourth and early fifth centuries contributed to the fall of the West Roman Empire (395-476), in his book The Fall of the West: The Slow Death of the Roman Superpower (2009).",

Augustus had named several of his own relatives as heirs, but as they all died, he named a son of his second wife, Livia, by her first marriage. Thus, Tiberius was not the last of any line established by Julius Caesar (Augustus' maternal great-uncle by blood) as he had no blood relation to Caesar at all. His successors, Caligula and Claudius were blood relatives of Julius Caesar through a maternal blood line dating back to Augustus's older sister, Octavia.

This was done, and Tarquin formed combined units of Roman and Latin troops.[26]",
            "Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula\nIn 147 BC, a new Lusitanian leader named Viriathus rebelled against the Roman forces. He had fled from Serbius Sulpicius Galba three years earlier, and, reuniting the Lusitanian tribes again, Viriathus began a guerrilla war that fiercely struck the enemy without giving open battle. He commanded many campaigns and arrived with his troops at the Murcian coasts. His numerous victories and the humiliation he inflicted upon the Romans made him worthy of the permanent place he holds in Portuguese and Spanish memory as a revered hero who fought without respite. Viriathus was assassinated about 139 BC by Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus, probably paid off by the Roman General Marcus Popillius Lenas. With his death, the organized Lusitanian resistance did not disappear but Rome continued to expand into the region.",
            "History of the Roman Empire\nLucius Septimius Severus was born to a family of Phoenician equestrian rank in the Roman province of Africa proconsularis. He rose through military service to consular rank under the later Antonines. Proclaimed emperor in 193 by his legionaries in Noricum during the political unrest that followed the death of Commodus, he secured sole rule over the empire in 197 after defeating his last rival, Clodius Albinus, at the Battle of Lugdunum. In securing his position as emperor, he founded the Severan dynasty.",
            "Campaign history of the Roman military\nThe Empire became gradually less Romanised and increasingly Germanic in nature: although the Empire buckled under Visigothic assault, the overthrow of the last Emperor Romulus Augustus was carried out by federated Germanic troops from within the Roman army rather than by foreign troops. In this sense had Odoacer not renounced the title of Emperor and named himself \"King of Italy\" instead, the Empire might have continued in name. Its identity, however, was no longer Roman\u00a0\u2013 it was increasingly populated and governed by Germanic peoples long before 476 AD. The Roman people were by the 5th century \"bereft of their military ethos\"[349] and the Roman army itself a mere supplement to federated troops of Goths, Huns, Franks and others fighting on their behalf."
