Instead, conflict may fester within the human mind as people imagine retribution that may or may not occur. One of the common attributes of imagined interactions is \"discrepancy\" where conversations that are imagined in the mind may be quite different from what actually happens in verbal discourse. For example, there is high discrepancy if you imagine that your boss will chastise you for being late in meeting a deadline; but then he/she tells you that they understand the delay because of other pending matters. Research has shown that discrepancy is associated with chronic loneliness and lack of satisfaction in interpersonal relationships.",

His modesty is perhaps one of the reasons that the generalization of the Kuder-Richardson's (1937) formulation of the coefficient of internal consistency reliability to a continuous case is generally ascribed to Lee Cronbach (1951), even though Hoyt had already made this generalization a decade earlier (Hoyt, 1941).

The song was first recorded in 1964 by British Beat group The Hollies who released it as a single in January 1965 where it peaked at number 9 in the United Kingdom. Two versions of this song were released by the Hollies.

This is often described as an \"erroneous\" version because it does not reflect what was heard on the single. Other examples of this practice include Stay from 1963 in which the famous guitar solo in the middle-eight was recorded live as the mono mix was being made, meaning the stereo version has a different solo, the one that was previously recorded on the multi-(4) track studio tape.

In general these releases have taken the form of a short story, a musical album, and visual art in the forms of illustrations in the book and cover art for the small book and the album. The short story that was published in IF02, \"Captioning for the Blind\" by Rebbecca Bengal, was selected to be included in collection \"Best non-required reading 2009\". At the time of this writing there have been eight IF series produced. In 2009, Monofonus Press Co-produced a micro budget film by Bryan Poyser, titled \"Lovers of Hate\". The movie was one of twelve selected to compete in the 2010 Sundance dramatic competition. In addition to financially supporting the film, Monofonus Press created a short non-fiction comic book, which was made up of a series of short interviews with twelve of the creators of the movie. In 2010, Monofonus Press began to produce a multi-media reading event called \"Teleportal Readings\".

The writers did not receive the usual $25 or $50 advance, but the company did pay for a one-hour demo recording which took place with studio players including Frank Owens (piano) and Kenny Karen (vocals). The session ended early so producer Ken Lauber spent the final ten minutes changing the original uptempo concept to a ballad approach. He asked Karen to do his best Jerry Butler impression, and asked Owens to play the way he had on the Dionne Warwick records (that piano part is still copied today on many of the newer versions of the song.) The next day, at Coburn\u2019s suggestion, the writers took the demo to Hy Weiss at Old Town Records for jazz singer Arthur Prysock.

The B-side (or \"flip-side\") is a secondary recording that has a history of its own: some artists released B-sides that were considered as strong as the A-side and became hits in their own right. Others took the opposite approach: producer Phil Spector was in the habit of filling B-sides with on-the-spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the A-side. With this practice, Spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side.",

            "The Alan Parsons Project That Never Was\nEric Woolfson sings The Alan Parsons Project That Never Was is an album by the progressive rock musician Eric Woolfson, co-creator with Alan Parsons of The Alan Parsons Project, as well as main songwriter and manager of the band. Released in 2009, this was Woolfson's final album before he died of cancer in December of that year. The album includes songs that remained unreleased since the Project time for various reasons; however, as Woolfson himself remarks in the booklet, Parsons' dislike for some of Woolfson's compositions would have often caused them to be excluded from a Project album in its very early stages - such as, for example, \"Steal Your Heart Away\", an \"unashamedly commercial\" song with a conventionally sentimental lyric, which Parsons, in Woolfson's words, would have absolutely detested. \"Somewhere in the Audience\" and \"Immortal\" are slightly re-arranged and re-recorded versions of two of Woolfson's demos for his 2003 musical about Edgar Allan Poe; the final versions of these songs, sung by the musical's protagonist Steve Balsamo, are featured on the album \"\". \"Train to Wuxi\" was the original version of \"Train to Freedom\", which is also included (with different lyrics) in the Poe musical and features Woolfson's one and only guitar solo.",

He showed a forehand that rivalled Petra's...and a backhand that excelled his countryman's\". The best results of Pierre Pellizza's career came at Monte Carlo, where he won the title in 1939 and 1946 (beating Yvon Petra in both finals). Pellizza played Davis Cup from 1938 to 1947. At the French Championships, Pellizza reached the quarter finals in 1946 (where he lost to Tom Brown) and 1947 (where he beat 8th seed Enrique Morea before losing to Tom Brown). At Wimbledon his best performance was in 1946, when he reached the quarter finals (he came from 2 sets down to beat Dragutin Miti\u0107 before losing to Jaroslav Drobny). At the U. S. Championships, Pellizza's best results were the last 16 in 1936 (where he lost to Bitsy Grant) and 1946 (where he lost an epic five set match to former champion Don McNeill). He turned professional in 1948. Like Paul F\u00e9ret and Henri Cochet, Pellizza was reinstated as an amateur. He played the French Championships for the last time in 1957, when he lost in the first round to Andres Gimeno.",

            "Hurricane Erika (2003)\nHurricane Erika was a weak hurricane that struck extreme northeastern Mexico near the Texas-Tamaulipas border in mid-August of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Erika was the eighth tropical cyclone, fifth tropical storm, and third hurricane of the season. At first, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) operationally did not designate it as a hurricane because initial data suggested winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h) at Erika's peak intensity. It was not until later data was analyzed that the NHC revised it to Category\u00a01 intensity in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm developed from a non-tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14. Under the influence of a high pressure system, Erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under favorable conditions. It made landfall as a hurricane on northeastern Mexico on August 16 and rapidly dissipated inland.",

Surnames are inherited from the parents, in the order of \"same as elder sibling, if any; specified by parents; or mother's last name,\" while given names must be chosen by the parents at birth.

The construct of having several names in the middle name convention is common to all systems, but to have multiple \"first\" names and only one middle and last name is a result of the blending of American and Spanish naming customs.

The players must take control of up to seven new (and selectable) Numans - Masala T. (Tikka) Masala (India, born in 1800), Johnny Sanders (United States, born on 7 August 1969), Makoto Kotobuki (Japan, born on 10 October 1975), Sophia Rayleigh (United Kingdom, born on 14 July 1970), Long Rui Huan (Communist China, born on 1 January 1953), Michael Fletcher (Jamaica, born on 25 September 1966), and, Karl Weisemann (Germany, born on 9 May 1957). All seven of these new Numans have different speed and power levels, and if less than four players are present, the CPU will randomly select up to three of the other Numans to compete against them (but they will be differently-coloured); the competition takes place over five days, and on the second, third and fourth ones, there are three (four on the third day) different events that must be qualified for. If any player fails to qualify for an event on these days, they will have to try it again by inserting another coin and continuing - and each of the Numans has their own unique ending sequence (much like the four lords from \"Exvania\"), which means a player will have to finish the game with all seven of them to see them all. The starter lights on the \"Hyper Glider\" event also look like Pac-Man, and a picture of him also appears on the side of a passing airship (along with: Prince Gilgamesh and Princess Ki from \"The Tower of Druaga\", Momo Chan out of \"Wonder Momo\", Valkyrie out of \"Valkyrie no Densetsu\", Hiromi Tengenji from \"Burning Force\" and Pitt and Patti from \"Tinkle Pit\") - while Miyuki Chan (from \"Ordyne\") can get seen running a \"Prince Paco\" (from \"Marvel Land\") taco stand, and the \"Dig Dug\" characters can be seen in the \"Ground Spike\" event as the crack a Numan makes in the ground goes deeper.",

He also writes songs and produced for Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Robyn, Ace of Base, Bon Jovi, 2gether and Britney Spears, and later he produced songs for Good Charlotte, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Hawthorne Heights, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, My Chemical Romance, Tokio Hotel, Lindsay Lohan, Dashboard Confessional, All American Rejects, Fall Out Boy, AFI, Evanescence, Hollywood Undead, t.A.T.u., Yellowcard, Hannah Montana, Linkin Park, Bullet for My Valentine and Taking Back Sunday. Most of his music is under the influence of today's modern pop punk, dance-punk, and emo music, but he does write some pop and hip-hop music as well. He also teamed up with Travis Barker in 2007, remixing popular hip-hop singles such as Throw Some D's, Party Like a Rockstar, and Crank That Soulja Boy. Even though he has written some of the works of some of the aforementioned artists, he is not one of the main producers of many of these artists and he chooses not to put his credit for his work. An original song written by such composer to be cited is yet to be found, however some has claimed an abbreviation of his name in one of the albums. In late 2008, he has decided to move in a small town near Oulu, Finland to raise his family and is a high school teacher and does accounting for bill paying in the summer to support the family, along with music production projects part-time, but he still continues to produce music today, but not as much as he used to. He did come back to help write a few new songs, such as In My Head by Jason Derulo. He has quit his part-time job in accounting to allow more time back in the music production business, to make a revival.",

Lanier calls these firms \u201cSiren Servers,\u201d alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. For example, he points to Google's translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. As a solution to this problem, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson\u2019s Project Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.",

We learn from the fact that Donald Judd surrounded himself with both contemporary sculpture and Navajo rugs; that Chaco Canyon and Roden Crater function as celestial instruments; and that the Very Large Array is a scientific research center with a powerful aesthetic presence on the land. We spend the semester living and working in the landscape with guest scholars that expand the range of our definition in disciplines including archeology, art history, architecture, ceramics, criticism, writing, design, and studio art. The immersive nature of how we experience the landscape triggers an amalgamated body of inquiry where students have the opportunity of time and space to develop authority in their work through direct action and reflection. Land Arts hinges on the primacy of first person experience and the realization that human-land relationships are rarely singular.",

            "Battle Monument (West Point)\nBattle Monument is a large Tuscan column monument located on Trophy Point at the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY. Designed by Stanford White, it was dedicated on 30 May 1897 by surviving Civil War veterans. The monument was financed by monthly contributions from the pay of the officers and soldiers of the regular army. The granite column, standing 46 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter, is reputed to be the largest column of polished granite in the Western Hemisphere. Inscribed on bronze straps belting the eight monumental \"cannon balls\" circling the column are the names of 2,230 Regular Army officers and soldiers who died for the Union during the Civil War. Designed by Frederick MacMonnies, a female statue sits atop the monument, representing \"fame\". The statue that now tops the monument is actually the second version of the statue. Just months after it was unveiled, MacMonnies agreed to replace the original statue after complaints that it was too large and awkward. Traditionally, the plebes at West Point made reference to the statue of Fame when giving the following reply to any upperclassman demanding to know \"How are they all?\": \"They are all fickle but one, sir.\" \"Who is the one?\" \"She who stands atop Battle Monument, for she has been on the same shaft since 1897;\" however, this is no longer current practice.",

            "Totem pole\nTotem poles are monumental carvings, a type of Northwest Coast art, consisting of poles, posts or pillars, carved with symbols or figures. They are usually made from large trees, mostly western red cedar, by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America (Washington, Oregon, and Canada's western province, British Columbia). The word \"totem\" derives from the Algonquian (most likely Ojibwe) word \"odoodem\" [o\u02c8tu\u02d0t\u025bm ], \"(his) kinship group\". The carvings may symbolize or commemorate cultural beliefs that recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events. The poles may also serve as functional architectural features, welcome signs for village visitors, mortuary vessels for the remains of deceased ancestors, or as a means to publicly ridicule someone. They may embody a historical narrative of significance to the people carving and installing the pole. Given the complexity and symbolic meanings of totem pole carvings, their placement and importance lies in the observer's knowledge and connection to the meanings of the figures and the culture in which they are embedded.",

The Kula ring was made famous by the father of modern anthropology, Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski, who used this test case to argue for the universality of rational decision making (even among 'natives'), and for the cultural nature of the object of their effort. Malinowski's path-breaking work, \"Argonauts of the Western Pacific\" (1922), directly confronted the question, \"why would men risk life and limb to travel across huge expanses of dangerous ocean to give away what appear to be worthless trinkets?\" Malinowski carefully traced the network of exchanges of bracelets and necklaces across the Trobriand Islands, and established that they were part of a system of exchange (the Kula ring), and that this exchange system was clearly linked to political authority. Malinowski's study became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of \"The Gift\" (\"Essai sur le don,\" 1925). Since then, the Kula ring has been central to the continuing anthropological debate on the nature of gift giving, and the existence of gift economies.",

Exceptional women who left an undeniable mark on history range from Lucretia and Claudia Quinta, whose stories took on mythic significance; fierce Republican-era women such as Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, and Fulvia, who commanded an army and issued coins bearing her image; women of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, most prominently Livia (58 BC-AD 29), who contributed to the formation of Imperial \"mores\"; and the empress Helena ( 250-330 AD), a driving force in promoting Christianity.",

While the rich placer gold fields in the Florence Basin brought thousands of prospectors and contributed to the establishment of Idaho Territory in 1863, the rush to Florence was short-lived as intensive mining depleted the richest ground.

            "Zachary Onyonka\nDr. Zachary T. Onyonka (1939 -1996) was a Kenyan politician. Onyonka was the foreign minister of his country from 1969 to 1996 under several other ministries up to and including Education, Economic Planning & Development and Trade and Foreign Affairs. Well Known within the Kisii community, he was always at loggerheads with then Nyaribari chache MP Simeon Nyachae until he died. Onyonka was elected to parliament in the 1969 elections from Kitutu West Constituency when he trounced the first cabinet minister from Kisii, Lawrence Sagini Ndemo. He was the youngest MP at about 25 years. He retained his parliamentary seat until his death. He was famous for leading an anti-Nyachae crusade in Kisii after he was released from Kodiaga prison in Kisumu. He had been arrested and charged with murder following a fatal shooting incident involving his bodyguards and a voter in then Kiututu West constituency campaigns. Ouru Ndege was shot dead after he attempted to attack Dr. Onyonka with a knife during the stormy 1983 campaigns along Kisii-Migori junction. His rival, John Bosco Mboga had just addressed his supporters in the area and when Onyonka, who was a cabinet minister in President Moi's government arrived, Ndege attempted to stub him with a sword leading to the minister's bodyguards shooting him to death. Onyonka and his guards apparently did not have a car at the time of the shooting. He was rescued by a matatutu driver, Joseph Moya Nyambariga, from Botoro area in Bomorenda, Bonchari, who drove the sieged minister in his matatu, christened Boringo Na Nagi Express to safety at Suneka Chief's camp. He was arrested soon after and locked up in Kisumu awaiting trial on murder charges. The prosecution was unable to prove the case against him and in 1984, Onyonka was set free. He had won the hotly contested election in absentia and after two years in the cold, Moi appointed him Minister for Foreign Affairs. Before the 1988 elections, Onyonka led a group of politicians from Kisii dubbed the Four Os. This stands for Onyonka, Obure (Chris from Bobasi) Omanga (Andrew from Nyaribari Chache) and Onyancha (David from West Mugirango) to launch the famous \"Kebirigo Declaration\" in which Nyachae was denounced and consigned into political Siberia. The Kebirigo declaration was a strong political ideology that stood for independence of each constituency in Kisii against manipulation from Nyachae. At that time, it had become increasingly evident that Nyachae who was a powerful civil servant was planning to plunge into active politics. Onyonka alleged that Nyachae had embarked on a series of secret campaigns, recruiting candidates against incumbent MPs so that he could make it to parliament with a clean slate of leaders, if he was cleared by KANU to run for elective seat.

Passaro, a former U.S. Army Ranger, allegedly beat Wali for two consecutive nights, causing grievous injuries including a fractured pelvis. Prosecutors would charge that Passaro ordered soldiers not to allow Wali to sleep, limited his access to food and water and subjected him to two consecutive nights of interrogation and beatings. Among other injuries, Wali suffered a suspected fractured pelvis that would have made it impossible for him to urinate. Witnesses testified that during one session Passaro, while wearing combat boots, kicked Wali in the groin hard enough to lift him off the ground, threw Wali to the ground, beat Wali on the arms and legs with a heavy Maglite flashlight, and that Passaro also vigorously thrust a flashlight into Wali's abdomen. After the second night of beatings, Wali begged the soldiers to kill him and moaned a phrase that meant, \"I'm dying.\" Wali died on his fourth day in custody.

            "Burwell family of Virginia\nThe Burwells (known as the Burls among Virginians ) were among the First Families of Virginia in the Colony of Virginia. John Quincy Adams once described the Burwells as typical Virginia aristocrats of their period: forthright, bland, somewhat imperious and politically simplistic by Adams' standards. In 1713, so many Burwells had intermarried with the Virginia political elite that Governor Spotswood complained that \" the greater part of the present Council are related to the Family of Burwells...there will be no less than seven so near related that they will go off the Bench whenever a Cause of the Burwells come to be tried.\" The Family was closely associated with the Fairfield Plantation, Gloucester County, Virginia, but several Burwells also built other famous Virginia plantations. Lewis Burwell III built the Kingsmill Plantation's manor house beginning in the 1730s. A few years later, Carter Burwell built Carter's Grove immediately to the east in what became the modern-day Grove Community. Several place names such as Burwell's Bay in Isle of Wight County, Virginia are named after the Burwells. Lewis Burwell \"Chesty\" Puller, (a.k.a. Chesty Puller) is a war hero (from West Point, Virginia) takes his name from three generations of Lewis Burwells who had a large influence on early Virginia."

Although she was an alternate for a space flight in 1979 she did not travel to space. She is most well known for her studies in the physiology of astronauts in outer space, as well as helping find cures for astronaut's motion sickness. Patricia found her love for science at a young age. Psychology and later psychophysiology showed her how to enhance human potential. 'What better field is there than to study the animal who created all the other fields? Humans!' This love was further helped by her psychologist aunt, whom she considered a deep inspiration because she had earned a PhD. Taking an engineering class in grad school where she took part in designing a space shuttle helped launch her desire to work in the field of space technology.",

He was a French soldier and a barrel cooper by trade in the Compagnie de Troyes, Troupes de la Marine. At the time it was common for French soldiers to adopt a nom de guerre often in reference to a trade, a place or a military rank. Antoine's nom de guerre was \"dit Pr\u00e9fontaine\", French for \"field (\"pr\u00e9\") with a spring (\"fontaine\")\". He arrived in New France in August 1685 and took part in Chevalier Pierre de Troyes successful raid on several English trading posts in the Hudson Bay and James Bay regions from March to October 1686 (Hudson Bay expedition (1686)). He married Marie Ronceray in 1688 in Longueuil, Qu\u00e9bec. Antoine's only son, Adrien (1693\u20131760), was an important businessman and a major figure in the economic development of New France. Adrien in turn had a son by the same name, who was a slave owner and was killed at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759. By the early-to-mid-19th century, the various families descended from Antoine dropped the Fournier part of the surname in favour of Pr\u00e9fontaine. Two brothers from Longueuil, Qu\u00e9bec, Alexis and Toussaint Fournier dit Pr\u00e9fontaine, participated in the initial engagement of the Lower Canada Rebellion, the Chambly Road incident of November 17, 1837. The rebels were inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, republicanism and the desire for responsible and representative government. Alexis, an officer in the militia, resigned his commission the day before joining the Rebellion. When the Rebellion collapsed in November 1838, and after proudly admitting their active participation, even under the possible penalty of death or exile, both brothers were to spend a year in jail along with 1,100 other Patriotes. Two of Toussaint's sons, Raymond and Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier, went on to have notable careers in their respective professions (see below).

For his whole career, Gersaint presided from his cramped boutique, hardly more than a permanent booth with a little backshop, on the medieval Pont Notre-Dame, in the heart of the heart of Paris, both creating and following fashion as he purveyed works of art and luxurious trifles to an aristocratic clientele, an artistic creator in his own way.",

His works include the major treatise \"Idea medicinae philosophicae\" (Ideal of Philosophical Medicine) (1571), which asserted the superiority of the ideas of Paracelsus to those of Galen. Severinus was a member of Denmark's intellectual elite. His education was supported by the Danish crown and his eventual appointment as royal physician conferred status and authority to his work and opinions. He was a contemporary and intellectual and personal associate of Tycho Brahe who likewise is associated with the evolution of chemistry during the seventeenth century. Daniel Sennert, a professor at Wittenberg wrote in 1619 that most chemical physicians followed the lead of Severinus and even referred to a \u201cSeverinian School\u201d of medical theory, which was based on the philosophy of Paracelsus. Scholars including Jole Shackelford and Hiro Hirai (\"Le concept de semences dans les th\u00e9ories de la mati\u00e8re \u00e0 la Renaissance\", 2005) have claimed that Severinus was an important predecessor of both Johann Baptista von Helmont and Pierre Gassendi.",

The vocals are the result of producer Brian Eno encouraging lead singer Bono to improvise lyrics while listening to the music for the first time. During the sole performance, Bono assumed that this was a rough cut\u2014something that could be tightened up, altered and corrected later. However, it was the pure improvisation and continuity of performance (as opposed to editing together several performances into one piece) that Eno was interested in, and it is this track that ended up on the final product.",

As Matthew Greenwald of AllMusic states, the song \"opens the film and accompanying soundtrack with a slice of real, rural backwoods gospel. Lyrically, one of the key lines is 'In the heat of the night/I'm feeling motherless somehow,' which clearly illustrates the main character's dilemma of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The main melody is guided by Charles' funky piano work and is buttressed by then-session ace Billy Preston's powerful, soulful organ trills. The underlying sense of drama that is so much a part of the film is reflected perfectly in this song, and the Ray Charles Singers add to this with a stately grace. It's perfect listening for a midsummer night when the temperature is just a bit too hot for comfort.\"",

Cedric Myton spent almost 3 years alongside Thompson, writing the tracks which would constitute the Royal Rasses album \"Humanity\". Cedric Myton also sang on every track on the album \"Humanity\". This album was a big success, although Cedric Myton left The Royal Rasses shortly after the release of \"Humanity\", his beautiful falsetto tones on every track, undoubtedly brought many fans to the attention of \"The Royal Rasses\" and the band continued without Cedric Myton, who went on to form \"The Congos\", alongside Roydel Johnson, who had a rich \"tenor\" and Watty Burnett who provided a \"Deep Barritone\", which combined with Cedric Mytons rich \"Falsetto\" anchored The Congos, whose music is easily distinguishable and highly regarded in not just reggae circles but worldwide. Unfortunately, due to both a dispute between the producer Lee\"Scratch\"Perry and Island Records favouritism of Bob Marley,the great first release LP from The Congos \"Heart Of The Congos\" was \"Shelved\" because it was deemed \"a strong album\" and Island Records.led by Chris Blackwell felt \"Heart Of The Congos\" would take away the limelight from Bob Marley.

Hadju also quotes noted jazz arranger and composer Gil Evans as saying, \"From the moment I first heard 'Chelsea Bridge,' I set out to try to do that. That's all I did ... tried to do what Billy Strayhorn did.\" In an analysis of the piece's haunting melody, Gunther Schuller writes: \"What Strayhorn exploited in the theme of 'Chelsea Bridge' is the duality of its chromatic harmonies. The theme is set in its first three bars in minor sixth chords with an added major seventh. However, Strayhorn causes us to hear these harmonies as if they were whole-tone chords. He achieves this effect by two means: 1) through orchestrational and dynamic stressing of the three upper notes [and] 2) by setting these sixth chords in their third inversions. This latter device takes away the rootedness of the harmonies, letting them float, so to speak, more towards the top of their structure.\"",

(It was also issued as the B-side to Bowie's January 1971 \"Holy Holy\" single.) An upbeat blues-rock number, \"Black Country Rock\" has been described as a \"respite\" from the musical and thematical heaviness of the remainder of the album. Its style has been compared to Marc Bolan's contemporary Tyrannosaurus Rex, down to Bowie's imitative vibrato in the final verse. According to producer Tony Visconti, Bowie had the music ready by the start of the sessions but the words were a last-minute addition in the studio, the singer doing his Bolan impression \"spontaneously ... because he ran out of lyrics ... we all thought it was cool, so it stayed.\"",

They camped there until the 1930s, asking for food from the residents. An emigrant massacre happened at the mouth of four Mile Canyon. The emigrants head camp of the main road for better feed and plentiful water. A band of Shoshone led by \"Paughatello\" killed all the members of the company except for one 15-year-old boy, who hid in a wash and made his way back to another company. He went on to Oregon or California with the team. The battle spanned over 40 acres along the creek. Seven wagons, 20 people, 33 horses and 14 head of livestock were involved. Wagon parts, bones, cap and ball pistols, swords and other relics could be found decades later. The first town site of Bennington was located on block West on highway 30 at the Cemetery and Wright Roads, where the old Amos Wright log cabin still stands. The first settlers, Jared Bullock, and Jonathan Hoopes, came in the fall of 1864 and settled on the south side of Bennington Creek. Then Evan M. Greene, Hyrum Hoopes and Edmond Homer came. Six families spent the winter in 1864.In 1865 and 1866 more people were called to settle . In 1866 the community was officially named after a town in Vermont where Brigham Young once lived. In 1873 the town had a meeting, and the present town site was chosen. A church, school, store/post office and new homes were eventually built. Evan Green was the first Presiding Elder serving from 1864 to 1865, followed by Dudley Merrell, who presided until 1870, then Alonzo became the first Bishop. Church was held in a vacant house until one could be built. The first living white baby born Feb. 18, 1866 was Winnifred Rebecca Wright daughter of Amos R. Wright. The first death was Admanza Greene who died of pneumonia at age 10. Jared Bullock's wife died of childbirth. She was buried at the end of the haystack and then moved to the present cemetery later. Deep snow, cold weather and primitive living conditions made living here hard. A traveling band and a dancing academy taught by John Dunn was organized to help people get through the long winter mounts. In 1934 there was a terrible drought. At that time each home and building at the new town site had their own well. They all dried up except the one at the school so people carried water from there. The WPA helped with a new water system and during 1934-35 the men of the community dug ditches and laid the pipe to their homes. They had a big celebration at its completion in August 1936.

            "Jose Tafoya\nJose Piedad Tafoya (1834 - ca. 1913), sometimes called the Prince of the Comancheros, was one of the more notable traders from New Mexico who traveled throughout the Southern Great Plains exchanging goods with the Comanches and their allies the Kiowa for stolen horses, cattle, and sometimes human captives. According to legend, he was seven feet tall. He was born in La Cuesta, New Mexico in 1834 and first visited the Great Plains as early as 1859. In the 1850s, he operated a sheep ranch in San Miguel County, New Mexico. His first wife was Maria de Jesus Perez. They married April 20, 1863 in Anton Chico, New Mexico. In the 1860s, he operated a trading post near what is now Quitaque, Texas. In the 1870s, he began sheep herding in Texas. He also at times acted as a scout for the US Army, possibly unwillingly. According to some sources, he was instrumental in the defeat of the Comanches at the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. He allegedly revealed the location of Comanche camps to Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie after being forced to do so either at the end of a rope or after being tied to a wagon wheel. Some believe that this story is mythical. Mackenzie credited another Comanchero scout named Johnson for finding the camps. Tafoya also participated in the ill-fated Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877. In 1879, he accompanied Lt. John L. Bullis on an expedition into southern New Mexico in pursuit of a band of marauding Lipan and Mescalero Apaches. By the 1880s, he had left Texas and was once again ranching sheep in New Mexico. He appeared in the U.S. Court of Claims in 1893 along with three other former Comancheros, where they admitted to having purchased cattle marked with brands belonging to Charles Goodnight and others. He had at least four children and probably died about 1913, when his will was filed, bequeathing his house to his second wife, Teresa Baca de Tafoya.",

Thus, although Huayna Capac named the infant Ninan Cuyochi as his first heir, sources differ as to whether the boy died first, was unacceptable because of an unfavorable divination, or even if Huayna simply forgot that he had named him when asked to confirm the nomination.

The PBS Nova film, in three-episodes of one hour each, was hosted by Kirk Johnson (Director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History); Peter Oxley directed the first episode while Gwyn Williams directed the second and third. The series describes the very beginnings and later developments of the North American continent: from the origin of planet Earth 4.54 billion years ago; to the various movements of tectonic plates and their effect on the sculpturing of the continent's land and mountains, including the Rocky Mountains, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon; to the emergence of life on the continent and its later evolution; and, finally, to the more recent settlement of the land by humans. According to Johnson, \"Most people will not have considered a time when there was no North America ... What was there before North America? How did it form? When did it start? How did it come together?\"",

Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Like his first two books, it features Inspector Hazlerigg, although not in a major role. It is, in fact, a very diffuse book in terms of its characters. Angus McMann, who was the chief protagonist of Gilbert's previous book, They Never Looked Inside, is briefly mentioned on the first page and makes a later appearance as a minor character. Hazlerigg does not appear until page 24 and thereafter only at intervals throughout the book. There are, in actuality, three other protagonists who, along with Hazlerigg, share the role of driving the narrative. One is Noel Anthony Pontarlier Rumbold (\"Nap\"), a junior solicitor in his father's London firm. Nap had spent four months on dangerous missions with the French maquis in occupied France during the war and is, apparently, still a Lieutenant-Colonel, D.S.O. A few years later he will be a main character in Gilbert's well-received novel \"Death Has Deep Roots\". Patrick (Paddy) Yeatman-Carter, an acquaintance of Nap's, is another lead character, as is his uncle, Alfred Lord Cedarbrook, a man with an astonishing background, much sought after by both the Foreign Office and the War Office during WWII and now, apparently, still affiliated with the Secret Service. As well as being a linguist, explorer, soldier, and diplomat, he also has a law degree. All three of them, to one degree or another, carry out private investigations, sometimes with the backing of Hazlerigg, sometimes not.",

Corbet was a strict disciplinarian, who regularly beat his men for the slightest infractions: so brutal was his regime that he provoked two mutinies, one simply at the rumour he was coming aboard a ship. These uprisings caused him to become even more vicious in his use of punishments and when he took his frigate HMS \"Africaine\" into action off \u00cele Bourbon, his men failed to support him and may even have murdered him. In addition to his obsession with discipline and obedience, Corbet was regarded as an inefficient commander, whose standards of gunnery and training were so poor that when his ship did go into action it was ill-equipped to fight the French frigates stationed in the Indian Ocean.",

He served on a number of ships and at several actions, but is best known for becoming caught up in the aftermath of the collapse of the Parthenopean Republic at Naples in 1799. Foote had already signed a convention with rebel leaders assuring their safety when he was overruled by Lord Nelson. As a result, most of the rebels, including women, were executed. Nelson was heavily criticised for his role in the executions, but Foote failed to protest the decision until many years later, once Nelson was dead. This overshadowed his career and he did not serve in a position of responsibility again. He commanded the royal yacht during most of the Napoleonic Wars, and although he was knighted and continued to rise through the ranks post-war he did not see active service.

The fifth Earl was a professional soldier, politician and courtier: he was friendly with Samuel Pepys, who refers to him several times as \"Colonel Dillon\" in his famous Diary. After the death of the tenth Earl, there were two prolonged investigations by the Irish House of Lords during the 1790s to ascertain the legitimacy of his son Patrick, against the rival claim by Robert Dillon, a descendant of the seventh son of the first Earl and the next male heir in line. These eventually found in Patrick's favour. The titles became dormant on the death of the eleventh Earl in 1816. However, in 1828 the United Kingdom House of Lords decided that the rightful heir to the peerages was Michael Dillon, a descendant of the seventh son of the first Earl, who became the twelfth Earl. The House of Lords Lords decided against Francis Stephen Dillon (d 1840), an inmate of a debtors' prison who dubiously claimed descent from the third son of the first Earl.

            "British Marine Art (Romantic Era)\nMarine art was especially popular in Britain during the Romantic Era, and taken up readily by British artists in part because of England's geographical form (an island). This article deals with marine art as a specialized genre practised by artists who did little or nothing else, and does not cover the marine works of the leading painters of the period, such as, and above all, J.M.W. Turner. The tradition of British marine art as a specialized genre with a strong emphasis on the shipping depicted began in large part with the artists Willem Van de Velde the Elder and his son, called the Younger in the early 18th century. The Van Veldes, originally from Holland, moved to England to work for King Charles II). By the 17th century, marine art was commissioned mostly by merchant seamen and naval officers and created by marine art specialists (rather than artists in general). In part, marine art served as a visual portrayal of Britain's power on the sea and as a way of historically documenting battles and the like. As British sea captains began to recognize the ability of marine artists to bring Britain's success on the sea to the public on land, some took on an active role in supporting this type of artwork. For example, marine artist Robert Cleveley was hired Captain William Locker to work in HMS Thames as a clerk, and Captain Locker, interested in employing artists, is believed to have played a significant role in encouraging Cleveley to work as a marine painter. Captains would act as marine artists' patrons, commissioning them to paint portraits of themselves and pictures depicting important battles. A few significant marine artists who were supported in this way by naval officers are (among others) Nicholas Pocock, Thomas Luny, and George Chambers. William Hodges, for example, who was trained to draw at William Shipley's Academy (studying under Richard Wilson), was hired by the Admiralty to finish his pictures from Cook's 1772 voyage for publication upon reaching home in 1775. Captains also commissioned artists to paint portraits of their ships.",

He was the nephew of Diebold Schilling the Elder of Berne. The younger Diebold was a somewhat scandalous figure, not unlike his father Hans, brother to the elder Diebold, an adventurer who had sought his fortune at the court of Matthias Corvinus, and returned destitute in 1488. Diebold was a secretary in Lucerne from 1479, and received the priesthood in 1481. His behaviour was so unpriestly, however, that the city council locked him into the tower in 1487, where he remained imprisoned for two years before he was released on parole of exhibiting more appropriate behaviour in the future. After his release he was soon back to his old ways, and after he had killed a man after a tavern brawl, he was fined and obliged to read a mass for his victim every year. Diebold was fiercely anti-French, and he accused the Bernese in particular, as well as his fellow chronicler Petermann Etterlin because of their friendly attitude towards France. Diebold's own sympathies lay with the German emperor Maximilian I, who personally invited him to the Reichstag in Konstanz in 1507. As an author, Diebold's most important contribution to the historiography of his times is his account of the years 1507\u20131509, the events of which he tells in his own words as an eye-witness.",

He was the first person to claim that Jesus Christ was born in or before 4 BC, not in AD 1, as the Christian era would imply. Suslyga was thus questioning the Anno Domini chronology introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 525. Suslyga presented this theory in his 1605 doctoral thesis entitled \"Theoremata de anno ortus et mortis Domini, deque universa Jesu Christi in carne oeconomia\" at the University of Graz. Among other arguments, Suslyga's treatise included the following: Herod's son, Philip the Tetrarch, renamed a city (Bethsaida) after Augustus's biological daughter, Julia. Since she had been exiled from Rome by Augustus in 2 BC, Suslyga assumed that Philip must have renamed the city prior to that date, and Herod must have died prior to Philip's becoming a ruler, which pushes the Massacre of the Innocents at least 3, if not more, years before AD 1. Dionysius Exiguus' chronology did need to be questioned; his chronology did not even match the point of view of the early Christians.

His tracks have ranged from hardcore rave techno to vibrant space-disco, and he's always maintained a healthy balance of humor and braininess. Active since 1990, he began his career releasing several 12\" EPs of aggressive, rave-ready hardcore techno on revered Belgian label R&S, including 12000 AD (1990), The Second Coming (1991), Move! (as Confusion Club, 1991), and The Love EP (1992). In 1994, Martinsen began releasing atmospheric techno singles as part of Illumination, his duo with Nicholas Sillitoe. The next year, Mental Overdrive released the single \"Disto Disco,\" which featured a B-side (\"Faith\") co-written by R&S artist Outlander, best known for the 1991 classic \"Vamp.\" The A-side appeared on Mental Overdrive's full-length debut Plugged, released on Martinsen's own Love OD Communications. The album showed a notable progression in his music, maintaining its rough, distorted hardcore techno sound while adding more cerebral elements, placing it closer to Warp's Artificial Intelligence series. Martinsen displayed his sense of humor with 1996's Unplugged, a limited conceptual release containing silent \"versions\" of the tracks on Plugged. 083 In 1997, Mental Overdrive signed to Virgin and released About Jazz, a significantly more house/disco-influenced EP than his previous work.

He took a few years off from releasing Mental Overdrive recordings, instead devoting time to Frost (his more pop-focused electronic duo with his wife Aggie Peterson) and Illumination, which released two albums on RCA.

Two years later, Mental Overdrive's single \"Spooks\" appeared on Prins Thomas' Full Pupp label.

The album was perfectly at home with the label's other left-field dance artists like Bj\u00f8rn Torske and Kim Hiorth\u00f8y, while maintaining the unique Mental Overdrive sound. Martinsen continued releasing Mental Overdrive singles on Full Pupp and Love OD, and contributed to Rune Lindb\u00e6k's Meanderthals project.

When Jarvis left the show in 1951, film star Eddie Albert took his place and co-hosted with White for six months until thirty-three and a half hours of live ad-lib television per week, featuring just the two of them, took its toll and he also resigned. White was then hosting the show alone, and is believed to have been the first female television talk show host as a result. After a period of White talking directly into the camera lens for hours at a stretch, the show began accepting guests to interact with her as well as gradually incorporating scripts and sketches. Similarly to Jackie Gleason's \"Honeymooners\" sketches on the Dumont Network during the same era, recurring sketches involving White as a housewife named Elizabeth caught on with the viewers to the point that expanding the sketches into a half-hour sitcom appeared to be the obvious next step. Series pianist George Tibbles began writing the sketches. Studio producer Don Fedderson, Tibbles and White formed a production company called \"Bandy Productions,\" named after Betty White's dog Bandit, and White changed over to a half hour sitcom format based on the Elizabeth sketches entitled \"Life With Elizabeth\", which ran in syndication for two years and sixty-five episodes. Across the decades, White would use the skills she had honed on \"Hollywood on Television\" by hosting her own talk show in 1954 and subsequent variety series as well as starring in numerous sitcoms, including \"Date with the Angels\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"The Betty White Show\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Golden Palace\" and \"Hot in Cleveland\", as well as hosting the 2012 prank show \"Betty White's Off Their Rockers\", which began airing 63 years after the premiere of \"Hollywood on Television\".",

            "Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nWhile the contributions of the Russian nationalistic group The Five were important in their own right in developing an independent Russian voice and consciousness in classical music, the compositions of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky became dominant in 19th century Russia, with Tchaikovsky becoming known both in and outside Russia as its greatest musical talent. His formal conservatory training allowed him to write works with Western-oriented attitudes and techniques, showcasing a wide range and breadth of technique from a poised \"Classical\" form simulating 18th century Rococo elegance to a style more characteristic of Russian nationalists or a musical idiom expressly to channel his own overwrought emotions.",
            "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and The Five\nIn mid- to late-19th-century Russia, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and a group of composers known as The Five had differing opinions as to whether should be composed following Western or native practices. Tchaikovsky wanted to write professional compositions of such quality that they would stand up to Western scrutiny and thus transcend national barriers, yet remain distinctively Russian in melody, rhythm and other compositional characteristics. The Five, made up of composers Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, C\u00e9sar Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, sought to produce a specifically Russian kind of art music, rather than one that imitated older European music or relied on European-style conservatory training. While Tchaikovsky himself used folk songs in some of his works, for the most part he tried to follow Western practices of composition, especially in terms of tonality and tonal progression. Also, unlike Tchaikovsky, none of The Five were academically trained in composition; in fact, their leader, Balakirev, considered academicism a threat to musical imagination. Along with critic Vladimir Stasov, who supported The Five, Balakirev attacked relentlessly both the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which Tchaikovsky had graduated, and its founder Anton Rubinstein, orally and in print.",
            "Death of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nOn 6 November 1893 [O.S. 25 October] , nine days after the premiere of his Sixth Symphony, the \"Path\u00e9tique\", Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky died in Saint Petersburg, at the age of 53. The official cause of death was reported to be cholera, most probably contracted through drinking contaminated water several days earlier. This explanation was accepted by many biographers of the composer. However, even at the time of Tchaikovsky's death, there were many questions about this diagnosis.",
            "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and the Belyayev circle\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's relations with the group of composers known as the Belyayev circle, which lasted from 1887 until Tchaikovsky's death in 1893, influenced all of their music and briefly helped shape the next generation of Russian composers. This group was named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Alexander Glazunov's work. By 1887, Tchaikovsky was firmly established as one of the leading composers in Russia. A favorite of Tsar Alexander III, he was widely regarded as a national treasure. He was in demand as a guest conductor in Russia and Western Europe, and in 1890 visited the United States in the same capacity. By contrast, the fortunes of the nationalistic group of composers known as The Five, which preceded the Belyayev circle, had waned, and the group had long since dispersed; of its members, only Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer. Now a professor of musical composition and orchestration at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov had become a firm believer in the Western-based compositional training that had been once frowned upon by the group.",
            "Symphonies by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form, the primary Western principle for building large-scale musical structures since the middle of the 18th century. Traditional Russian treatment of melody, harmony and structure actually worked against sonata form's \"modus operandi\" of movement, growth and development. Russian music\u2014the Russian creative mentality as a whole, in fact\u2014functioned on the principle of stasis. Russian novels, plays and operas were written as collections of self-contained tableaux, with the plots proceeding from one set-piece to the next. Russian folk music operated along the same lines, with songs comprised as a series of self-contained melodic units repeated continually. Compared to this mindset, the precepts of sonata form probably seemed as alien as if they had arrived from the moon.",
            "Ballet (music)\nBallet as a music form progressed from simply a complement to dance, to a concrete compositional form that often had as much value as the dance that went along with it. The dance form, originating in France during the 17th century, began as a theatrical dance. It was not until the 19th century that ballet gained status as a \u201cclassical\u201d form. In ballet, the terms \u2018classical\u2019 and \u2018romantic\u2019 are chronologically reversed from musical usage. Thus, the 19th century classical period in ballet coincided with the 19th century Romantic era in Music. Ballet music composers from the 17th\u201319th centuries, including the likes of Jean-Baptiste Lully and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, were predominantly in France and Russia. Yet with the increased international notoriety seen in Tchaikovsky\u2019s lifetime, ballet music composition and ballet in general spread across the western world.",

            "Russian literature\nRussian literature refers to the literature of Russia and its \u00e9migr\u00e9s and to the Russian-language literature of several independent nations once a part of what was historically Rus', the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union. The roots of Russian literature can be traced to the Middle Ages, when epics and chronicles in Old Russian were composed. By the Age of Enlightenment, literature had grown in importance, and from the early 1830s, Russian literature underwent an astounding golden age in poetry, prose and drama. Romanticism permitted a flowering of poetic talent: Vasily Zhukovsky and later his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. Prose was flourishing as well. The first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol. Then came Ivan Turgenev, who mastered both short stories and novels. Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky soon became internationally renowned. In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and became a leading dramatist. The beginning of the 20th century ranks as the Silver Age of Russian poetry. The poets most often associated with the \"Silver Age\" are Konstantin Balmont, Valery Bryusov, Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Nikolay Gumilyov, Osip Mandelstam, Sergei Yesenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Marina Tsvetaeva and Boris Pasternak. This era produced some first-rate novelists and short-story writers, such as Aleksandr Kuprin, Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin, Leonid Andreyev, Fyodor Sologub, Aleksey Remizov, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Andrei Bely.",

Born in Russia, he studied at the Moscow Conservatory with Nikolai Zverev and Anton Arensky, and while there, composed some of his most famous works, including the first piano concerto (Op. 1) and the Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, No. 2). Although spread over three different opuses, he did go on to complete an important set of 24 preludes in all the major and minor keys. His Symphony No. 1 (Op. 13) was one of his first compositions as a \"Free Artist\" after graduation, and subsequently his first critical failure. The derision he received sent him into depression. After being sent through autosuggestive therapy, he composed his second piano concerto (Op. 18), which is still part of the major orchestra repertoire today. In 1909, he made his first tour of the United States, and composed Piano Concerto No. 3 (Op. 30), notable for its difficult cadenza. After this, due to migration from Russia in 1917 and his busy concert career, his output as a composer decreased, and during this period, he completed only six compositions. His last work, \"Symphonic Dances\" (Op. 45), was completed in 1940.",

He was hailed as a child prodigy in Odessa but almost murdered by Imperial Guards during the 1905 Pogrom. He fled to Berlin and was declared the heir of Anton Rubinstein and likened to Ignacy Paderewski and Teresa Carre\u00f1o before being imprisoned as an Imperial Russian enemy alien during World War I. In the interwar period he became internationally recognized as one of the greatest pianists in the world and regarded in Europe as the finest living interpreter of Brahms. He also formed a trio which toured Europe with phenomenal success and was declared the finest in the world. Towards the beginning of 1933 he was warned by Richard Strauss in a musically-coded secret message that he had become a Nazi target due to his Jewish heritage. He fled to Australia a few days before the Nazi seizure of power and put his musical career on hold to help people escape the Third Reich. After World War II he returned to the stage and astounded the toughest of critics with the power, depth and maturity of his interpretations. Although his fame dimmed after he ceased touring because he had made no commercial (solo) studio recordings, his rediscovery was sparked in 2015 by the first releases of his live performances. These have caused considerable excitement among music lovers and prompted some experts to declare Spivakovsky one of the greatest pianists they have ever heard.",

Modernism, impressionism, post-romanticism, neoclassicism, expressionism, and, later, minimalism were all important movements. Atonality, serialism, \"musique concr\u00e8te\" and electronic music were all developed during this period. Jazz was an important influence on many composers in this period.",

            "History of rail transport in Australia\nAustralians generally assumed in the 1850s that railways would be built by the private sector. Private companies built railways in the then colonies of Victoria, opened in 1854, and New South Wales, where the company was taken over by the government before completion in 1855, due to bankruptcy. South Australia's railways were government owned from the beginning, including a horse-drawn line opened in 1854 and a steam-powered line opened in 1856. In Victoria, the private railways were soon found not to be financially viable, and existing rail networks and their expansion was taken over by the colony. Government ownership also enabled railways to be built to promote development, even if not apparently viable in strictly financial terms. The railway systems spread from the colonial capitals, except in cases where geography dictated a choice of an alternate port.",

The Queen City Kings were formed by a Vice Lord member who moved to Charlotte from Chicago in the mid 1990s. He initially established a Vice Lord faction in the Cedar Greene Apartment Complex but as a way to be inclusive of another Vice Lord, an agreement was made by all parties involved to change the name of the gang to the Queen City Kings, which played on the nickname of the City of Charlotte, which people dub the \"Queen City.\" The name, according to the Original Kings, was the gang's affirmation to the claiming of the city, stating: \"The Queen City is our bitch, which makes us the Kings.\" Shortly thereafter, he was incarcerated on an unrelated offense. A Cedar Greene Apartments resident named \"Corn,\" along with Corn's half-brother, was left in charge. Corn proved to be a very charismatic and dedicated leader, remaining loyal to the movement until his suicide, several years later. The Kings, which originally stood for Knowledgeable Islamic Nubian Gods, then renamed Krucial Islamic Nubian Gods, was meant to be a Charlotte, home-grown version of the Chicago Vice Lords. The Kings were structured similar to the Los Angeles gangs, but instead of \"Original Gangsta\" (OG) or \"Baby Gangsta\" (BG) the Queen City Kings used \"Original King\" (OK) or \"Baby King\" (BK).

Some of them were successful but many of them were unknown in their respective neighborhoods. Among the factions were the Wilmore Kings (WMK), Tuckaseegee Kings (TSK), Beatties Ford Kings (BFK), Derita King (DTK), North Side Jamaican Kings (NJK), Westside Kings (WSK) the Creek Town Kings (CTK or FOC), The Cedar Greene Kings (CGK), the Woodview Kings (WVK), the Hidden Valley Kings (HVK) among others of these various sets, the Hidden Valley Kings became the most prominent.",

Surnames are inherited from the parents, in the order of \"same as elder sibling, if any; specified by parents; or mother's last name,\" while given names must be chosen by the parents at birth. The calling name (Swedish \"tilltalsnamn\", French \"Pr\u00e9nom usuel\") by which the person is normally identified in conversation, is in Scandinavian countries (and previously in France) one of the given names, not necessarily the first.
