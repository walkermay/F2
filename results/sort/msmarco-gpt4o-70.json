Though a truly awful businessman, he was the ingenious engineering power behind the industrial revolution. At the start of the 18th century, in the poor Scottish seaport town of Greenock, the grandfather of James Watt sets up a school of mathematics. His son becomes a prosperous shipbuilder and provider of shipping products. His unique selling point is his âskill in the making of the most delicate instrumentsâ.",

Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.",
      "Carbon is the 19th most abundant element in the earth's crust, at 0.027%. It is found as carbon dioxide, carbonate rocks, and living matter. It occurs in elemental form in small amounts, as graphite and diamond. The properties of these forms of carbon, which are very important, are discussed in separate sections.",

This series of compounds are called alkanes (CnH2n+2) .The lighter ones are gases and used as fuels.The middle ones (7 Carbons to 12 Carbons) are liquids used in petrol (gasoline).The higher ones are waxy solids.rganic chemistry is the study of the properties of the compounds of carbon. All carbon compounds except for a few inorganic carbon compounds are organic. Inorganic carbon compounds include the oxides of carbon, the bicarbonates and carbonates of metal ions, the metal cyanides, and a few others.",

      "Who Invented Sunscreen. The who of who invented sunscreen is controversial. Four scientist have all been credited with inventing sunscreen products. Milton Blake, an Australian chemist is credited with being the first to experiment with sun protection. He created a sunburn cream in his kitchen. Hamilton Laboratories started producing and selling the cream in the 1930âs.",
      "They realized that the skin could be protected by filtering out those wavelengths. This led to the first commercially available sunscreen, produced in 1928 in the United States. It was an emulsion made of PABA benzyl salicylate and benzyl cinnamate. Sunscreens were soon widely available, although not widely used.unblock, however, protects the skin by reflecting and scattering the sunâs rays. The best-known example of a sunblock is zinc oxide, the thick white substance that lifeguards apply to their noses. Sunblocks are highly effective, but are typically sticky creams that are impractical for full body use.",
      "His Glacier Cream, introduced in 1938, was the first commercially viable sun protection cream. In the 1962, Franz Greiter introduced the concept for the Sun Protection Factor rating system-SPF. This has become the worldwide standard for measuring the effectiveness of sunscreen.",
      "When was Sunscreen invented? The chemist, HA Milton Blake of South Australia in the early 1930s produced a sun burn cream after experimentation. In 1936, the first sunscreen was invented by chemist Eugene Schueller, the founder of LâOreal and in 1944 a suntan cream was invented by a Florida pharmacist, Benjamin Green. Category: Skin Care.",
      "One of the first sunscreens was invented by chemist Franz Greiter in 1938. Greiter's sunscreen was called Gletscher CrÃ¨me or Glacier Cream and had a sun protection factor (SPF) of 2. The formula for Glacier Cream was picked up by a company called Piz Buin, named after the place Greiter was sunburned and thus inspired to invent sunscreen.",
      "Additionally, Coppertone created the first sweat-proof sunscreen for athletes, the first disappearing colored sunscreen for kids, and the first sunscreens to protect against UVB and UVA rays in 1985.",
      "Otto Veiel of Linz, Austria, published one of the first reports of a substance being used to protect skin from ultraviolet rays in 1878. He discovered that tannin worked as a kind of sunscreen.However, the staining properties of tannin limited the usefulness of his find.unblock, however, protects the skin by reflecting and scattering the sunâs rays. The best-known example of a sunblock is zinc oxide, the thick white substance that lifeguards apply to their noses. Sunblocks are highly effective, but are typically sticky creams that are impractical for full body use.",
      "Sunscreens started out with pasty zinc oxide that no one would use. So scientists created sunscreens with clear chemicals that absorbed UV light. In 1944, CoppertoneÂ® became the first mass marketed sunscreen.Fast forward to now, when about a billion dollars worth of sunscreen are sold each year in the United States.unscreens started out with pasty zinc oxide that no one would use.

Apply sunscreen at least 15 to 30 minutes before going outside to allow for absorption. 2  Don't rely on sunscreen alone to protect your skin. 3  Wear tightly woven clothing and a broad-brimmed hat, limit sun time, and seek shade during the hottest hours of the day. 4  Don't make purchases based on brand alone.",
      "Kenneth A. Arndt, MD, clinical professor of Dermatology at Harvard Medical School, Boston, wrote in the current Bottom Line Personal that sunscreen and sunblock are not the same. Sunblock is opaque and blocks almost all of the sun's UVA and UVB rays. It consists largely of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Sunblock does not have to be reapplied every few hours. Sunscreens are less visible on the skin and are designed to protect against UVA, UVB, or both.",

      "Of the 17 sunscreen ingredients approved in the U.S., 15 are organic, or chemical, sunscreens: They work by absorbing damaging ultraviolet radiation (UVR). These chemical sunscreens consist of innately unstable molecules, but in the past few years manufacturers have started adding stabilizers like octocrylene.",
      "Dr Perry argues that unlike physical sunscreen or sunscreen with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, chemical sunscreens get absorbed in the skin and quickly travel their way to the bloodstream.",
      "It is not clear as to who is the inventor of the first-ever sunscreen, but Milton Blake, a chemist from South Australia, is widely acknowledged as the first one to come up witâ¦h (although unsuccessfully) a sunburn cream in the 1930s.",
      "These guidelines â some parts of which never took full effect â mostly dealt with establishing SPF testing and labeling. However, the official document did state, âIn the long run, suntanning is not good for the skin.â. 1988 The F.D.A. approves a sunscreen product containing avobenzone, a UVA-only filter. The other approved filters until then were UVB ones that had incidental UVA protection. 1997 The F.D.A. allows sunscreen makers to market the fact that their products contain avobenzone for UVA protection. 2006 The F.D.A. misses a deadline set by Congress to approve proposed guidelines for sunscreens.",
      "Sunscreens commonly include ingredients that act as âpenetration enhancersâ and help the product adhere to skin. As a result, many sunscreen chemicals are absorbed into the body and can be measured in blood, breast milk and urine samples. Active ingredients in sunscreens come in two forms, mineral and chemical filters. Each uses a different mechanism for protecting skin and maintaining stability in sunlight.",
      "But, the two might not be created equally: Physical sunscreen is generally better tolerated on those with sensitive skin, as chemical sunscreens have toxins in them which can be absorbed and can cause allergic reactions on the skin level, he says.",
      "Sunscreen use has risen in past decades, as media outlets and doctors tout the benefits of sunscreen for protecting against skin cancer and sunburn. The problem with this billion dollar a year market: not all sunscreens are created equal and in many cases sunscreen is harmful, not helpful.",
      "These products typically include a combination of two to six of these active ingredients: oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate. Mineral sunscreens use zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide. A handful of products combine zinc oxide with chemical filters.",
      "Sunscreens are commonly rated and labeled with a sun protection factor (SPF) that measures the fraction of sunburn-producing UV rays that reach the skin. For example, SPF 15 means that 1/15th of the burning radiation reaches the skin through the recommended thickness of sunscreen.",
      "THE CHEMISTRY OF SUNSCREEN. Sunscreen: (snskrn) n. Chemical or physical agents that protect the skin from sunburn and erythema by absorbing or blocking ultraviolet radiation.

      "The participants repeated seven to eight sets of the exertion-rest intervals, equaling just about 4 minutes of actual workout time. The results were so striking that this type of training was named after its creator, hence Tabata training. Subjects who performed Tabata training five days a week for six weeks (a total of 120 minutes of exercise over the month and a half) improved both their aerobic and anaerobic endurance. In fact, subject's anaerobic fitness increased by a whopping 28%.",

      "Then, with the help of a lawyer from South Brooklyn Legal Services, Mr. Sarmiento began turning over some stones. He found that MERS might have violated tax laws by waiting too long before transferring his mortgage. He also found that MERS could not prove that it had transferred both note and mortgage, as required by law.",

    "question": "who planned caesar's death",
    "docs": [
      "This is simply a theory, but Caesar did dismiss his bodyguards shortly before he was killed, finalized his will, and gripped in his dead hand a note of warning (this was discovered in the recorded autopsy of Caesar's death).",
      "The mix-up of their identities leads to the wrongful death of the poet Cinna: this, too, is thought to be historically accurate. The Greek biographer Plutarch states that the Cinna killed by the mob of angry Roman's following Julius Caesar's death was a poet. Cinna the conspirator strongly disapproved of how Julius Caesar ran the Roman Empire. He was the leader of a popular political party whose views were essentially anti-aristocratic. In the play Julius Caesar, he is one of the key conspirators to plan Caesar's death. He is the one who first plants the idea of inviting Marcus Brutus to join their cause: he suggests this to Cassius.",
      "Brutus forces Caesar to go to the Senate by telling him that it would be womanish for him not to go. When Caesar arrives at the Senate, the conspirators move toward him. The assassination begins and when it is over, Caesar has over thirty-five stab wounds. Ironically, Caesar falls at the foot of Pompey's statue. The death of Pompey created many problems for Caesar since Pompey himself had many followers in Rome. That was one thing at the root of Caesar's assassination, among many.",
      "Strauss says the two enlisted the help of a third man to help carry out Caesarâs assassination. Photo: Getty Images (left). Shakespeare cites two men, Gaius Cassius Longinus (Cassius) and Marcus Junius Brutus (Brutus), as having ignited the conspiracy against Caesar.",
      "The first person that lets the audience know that someone has spoken out of turn about the conspiracy comes to the forefront in Act II, Scene iii. It is Artemidorus, the teacher, who favors Caesar and wants to warn him. He has written a letter that he hopes Caesar will read before he enters the senate. In his letter, Artemidorus names the conspirators and informs Caesar that these men are determined to assassinate him.",
      "Caesar's assassination is one of the most famous scenes of the play, occurring in Act 3, scene 1 (the other is Mark Antony's funeral oration Friends, Romans, countrymen.) After ignoring the soothsayer, as well as his wife's own premonitions, Caesar comes to the Senate.",
      "Death of a Dictator. Nicolaus of Damascus wrote his account of the murder of Caesar a few years after the event. He was not actually present when the assassination occurred but had the opportunity to speak with those who were.",
      "Biographers describe tension between Caesar and the Senate, and his possible claims to the title of king. These events were the principal motive for Caesar's assassination. The Senate named Caesar dictator perpetuo (dictator in perpetuity).",
      "At the time of Caesar's assassination, Octavius was with some of his soldiers in modern-day Albania. Upon hearing the news he went to Italy and recruited an army from among Caesar's veterans, gaining their loyalty by stressing that he was Caesar's heir.",
      "As Caesar entered the Roman senate, he dispatched his security force and was subsequently stabbed by other Roman senators, including Servilius Casca and Brutus, the latter of whom supposedly brought his knife to Caesar's groin. Upon Caesar's death, his adopted son, Octavian, was left in charge of Rome.",
      "These events were the principal motive for Caesar's assassination. The Senate named Caesar dictator perpetuo (dictator in perpetuity).

      "Artemidorus: philosopher who attempts to warn Caesar about the conspiracy. Brutus: Friend of Caesar, and leading member of the conspirators. Caesar: Ruler of Rome. Calpurnia: Caesar's wife. Casca: Conspirator. Cato: An ally of Brutus. Cassius: Leader of the conspiracy against Caesar.",
      "Thanks to the writings of Nicolaus of Damacus who was privy to the details of Caesar's assassination, though not witness to it, we know the following historical details. In January of 49 BC, Julius Caesar led his army across the Rubicon River in Northern Italy and plunged the Roman Republic into civil war.",
      "The POET Cinna enters and is mistaken for Cinna the conspirator-this shows the people are in a frenzy and want blood to pay for Caesar's death. It also foreshadows the deaths of the conspirators in the last 2 acts.",
      "Let Antony and Caesar fall together. (2.1.168-174). By suggesting that they also murder Antony, Cassius removes the veil of honor from the plan. This isn't simply about protecting Rome from tyranny; it's making practical moves to protect them from further annoyances in whatever it is they plan after the murder.",
      "And it's his honour that caused him to want to kill Caesar. Cassius and co. had convinced Brutus that killing Caesar was in the best interests of Rome. They made him believe that Caesar only wanted power and was going to try for King. Brutus believed them and so from there he wanted Julius Caesar to die.",
      "He writes a letter of warning to Caesar, telling him to beware of all the chief conspirators, naming them singly. He hopes to be able to hand it to Caesar personally as he passes: If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;",
      "Shortly after, a slave arrived at Caesarâs house to warn him of the plot against his life. But he was too late: Caesar had left. A short while later, a man named Artemidorus of Cnidus pushed through the jostling crowds and handed Caesar a roll setting out details of the plot.",
      "The crown was the last straw. A group of senators secretly began plotting against Caesar from around February of 44 B.C., and it consisted of some of the most influential men in Rome. Around this time rumors of assassination attempts abounded, as did graffiti against Caesar.",
      "Caesar's life and death were dramatized in the play Julius Caesar, with Caesar's famous death line: Et tu, Brute? Then fall Caesar!. Caesar is thought to have been assassinated on March 15th, a date known in the Roman calendar as the Ides of March...The ruling titles Kaiser and Czar are derived from the name of Caesar...

Caesar had a famous romance with Egyptian ruler and he fathered her son Caesarian.",
      "However, the result of Caesarâs assassination was to plunge the Roman world into a new round of civil wars, with the Republican forces of Brutus and Cassius vying for supremacy against Octavian and Mark Antony. After being defeated by Antony at a battle in Philippi, Greece, in October 42 B.C., Cassius killed himself.",
      "For other uses, see Caesar (disambiguation).

      "Historically, Brutus committed suicide after the second battle of Philippi nearly 3 weeks after Cassius' death. In the series the events of the battles are concentrated and his death mirrors Caesar's; he is surrounded and stabbed to death by a throng of enemy soldiers.rutus also insists that Mark Antony, Caesar's right-hand man and Lucius Vorenus, the new senator Caesar has appointed, must not be harmed. On the Ides of March, Brutus and the other senators involved in the plot attack Caesar on the Senate floor, stabbing him to death.",

      "Despite the overwhelming assault on him, Caesar still had the presence of mind to maintain his dignity for posterity purposed. Resigning himself to the assassination, Caesar pulled the folds of his toga over his head so as to prevent anyone seeing his face at death. In all, Caesar was stabbed 23 times, and inevitably collapsed.",
      "Although Cicero disliked Caesarâs dictatorship and approved conspiracy against him, he was not involved in his assassination. After Caesarâs death, he tried to reconcile his assassins and Mark Antony but he soon concluded that the latter is threat to the Republic.",
      "Brutus was the son of Caesarâs mistress Servilia (some mistakenly believed he was Caesarâs son) and married to the Roman orator Catoâs daughter Portia. Marcus Porcius Cato (or Cato the Younger), a strong supporter of Pompey and outspoken critic of Caesar, had committed suicide in 46 BCE while in North Africa.",

X-rays were discovered in 1895 by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen (1845-1923) who was a Professor at Wuerzburg University in Germany.Working with a cathode-ray tube in his laboratory, Roentgen observed a fluorescent glow of crystals on a table near his tube.hortly after the discovery of X-rays, another form of penetrating rays was discovered. In 1896, French scientist Henri Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity. Many scientists of the period were working with cathode rays, and other scientists were gathering evidence on the theory that the atom could be subdivided.",

Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet.",
      "From its discovery in 1846 until the subsequent discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. Upon Pluto's discovery, Neptune became the penultimate planet, save for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer to the Sun than Neptune.",
      "Who Discovered Neptune. The fourth biggest planet in the Solar System, Neptune is named after the god of the sea, Neptune, from Roman mythology. Neptune is one of the three planets that were not visible to the human eye; the other two planets are Uranus and Pluto (now classified as a dwarf planet).",
      "Suffice it to say that as a result of those calculations, Neptune was discovered on September 23, 1846 by the astronomer Johann Galle and his student Heinrich d'Arrest, after only thirty minutes of searching the sky, within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier.",
      "Leverrier actually wanted to name it after himself. However, the name Neptune was proposed and became the standard used by scientists. Pluto (now a dwarf planet) was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. According to the Nine Planets Website, other names suggested for Pluto included Lowell, Atlas, Artemis, Perseus, Vulan, Tantalus, Idana, Cronus, Zymal and Minerva (suggested by the New York Times).",
      "Neptune discovery telescope. The telescope at New Berlin Observatory (1835â1913), that discovered Neptune, was an achromatic refractor of 9 Paris inch (9.6 English inches or 24.4 cm) aperture made by the late Joseph Fraunhofer's firm, Merz und Mahler.",
      "Neptune has 14 known moons, which are named for minor water deities in Greek mythology. By far the largest of them is Triton, discovered by William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself; over a century passed before the discovery of the second natural satellite, Nereid.",
      "This was the first reliable determination of Neptune's rotation period. The 12 to 18 hour rotation periods found for the atmospheric features differ from the above value because of winds. (see the related link for additional information) It takes Neptune 16 hours and 6 minutes to rotate once on its axis.  This means that one day on Neptune is the same as about 16 hours on  Earth.",
      "Neptune is one of the two planets classified as an ice giant.. Like Uranus, its composition is made up more heavily of ices than the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. Neptune's atmosphere is composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane to create the bluish color.Unlike the terrestrial planets, Neptune and the other gas giants still hold much of the atmosphere they had at their formation. Temperature and pressure shift at different heights.nstead, the gas stretches down to the water-ammonia ocean that makes up the planet's mantle. Scientists have defined the surface of Neptune as the region where the surface pressure is equivalent to the pressure on Earth at sea level. The temperature at this surface is approximately minus 346 F (minus 201 C).",
      "Like Uranus, Neptune appears blue due to the methane in its atmosphere, but Neptune also has vivid blue clouds; it is not known what gives the clouds their color. Like all the other gas giants, Neptune has rings. Prior to images from Voyager 2, these rings were only visible from Earth as faint, dark arcs.",
      "Percival Lowell postulated the existence of a planet beyond Neptune and began in earnest in 1905 to search for it. He spent his remaining 11 years in a lengthy mathematical and observational search for the elusive âtrans-Neptunianâ planet.",
      "Facts About. Who Discovered Neptune. The fourth biggest planet in the Solar System, Neptune is named after the god of the sea, Neptune, from Roman mythology. Neptune is one of the three planets that were not visible to the human eye; the other two planets are Uranus and Pluto (now classified as a dwarf planet).",
      "The eighth planet from the sun, Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical predictions rather than through regular observations of the sky.(Galileo had recorded it as a fixed star during observations with his small telescope in 1612 and 1613.).early 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the sun, Neptune orbits the sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth.",
      "Atmospheric composition. Neptune's atmosphere is made up predominately of hydrogen and helium, with some methane. The methane is part of what gives Neptune its brilliant blue tint, as it absorbs red light and reflects bluer colors. Uranus also has methane in its atmosphere, but has a duller shading.",
      "Neptune Facts. Neptune has 14 known moons; 7 small named ones and Triton plus four discovered in 2002 and one discovered in 2003 and S/2004 N1 in 2013.

Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the fourth largest (by diameter).Neptune is smaller in diameter but larger in mass than Uranus.eptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the fourth largest (by diameter). Neptune is smaller in diameter but larger in mass than Uranus.",
      "The Interior of Neptune Our knowledge of the internal structure of Neptune is inferred from the planet's radius, mass, period of rotation, the shape of its gravitational field and the behavior of hydrogen, helium, and water at high pressure.",
      "Surface and atmosphere. Scientists believe that Neptune is made up chiefly of hydrogen, helium, water, and silicates. Silicates are the minerals that make up most of Earth's rocky crust, though Neptune does not have a solid surface like Earth. Thick clouds cover Neptune's surface. Its interior begins with a region of heavily compressed gases.",
      "Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet.",
      "September 23, 1846 by Johann Gottfried Galle            Neptune was discovered on September 23, 1846, by by Johann Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest at the Berâ¦lin Observatory, using a predicted position by Urbain LeVerrier.",
      "But by the mid-20th century and after, thanks to improvements in ground-based telescopes and the development of robotic space probes, many more moons would be discovered. Neptune now has 14 recognized satellites, and in honor of of their parent planet, all are named for minor water deities in Greek mythology.",
      "Early telescopic discoveries. Due to Neptune's distance from Earth, only two moons were confirmed with ground telescopes before Voyager 2. The first one, Triton, was actually discovered only 17 days after the planet itself was found.",
      "Uranus was discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781. Herschel was probably the most famous astronomer of the 18th century. In addition to discovering the planet Uranus, he also observed and cataloged over 800 double stars and 2,500 nebulae.e was the first astronomer to correctly describe the spiral structure of our Milky Way Galaxy. Neptune was discovered by John Couch Adams in 1846. Adams was an English astronomer and mathematician who, at the age of 24, was the first person to predict the position of a planetary mass beyond Uranus.",
      "Who Discovered Neptune. The fourth biggest planet in the Solar System, Neptune is named after the god of the sea, Neptune, from Roman mythology.",
      "Neptune is about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the sun. Because Neptune is so far from the sun, it receives very little sunlight. In fact, the sunlight that reaches Neptune is 900 times less intense than the sunlight that reaches Earth.",
      "How did Neptune get its name? The Romans named the five planets closest to the Sun after their most important gods. These were the only planets that were bright enough for them to see. Later, when telescopes were used, other planets were discovered. Astronomers decided to continue naming the planets after Roman Gods. Neptune, a blueish planet, was named after the Roman god of the sea.",
      "Neptune Facts. Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and last of the known planets. While it is the third largest planet with respect to mass, it is only the fourth largest in terms of diameter. Due to its blue coloration, Neptune was named after the Roman god of the Sea.",
      "The largest Neptunian moon, Triton, was discovered just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered. Neptune has a storm similar the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. It is commonly known as the Great Dark Spot and is roughly the size of Earth. Neptune also has a second storm called the Small Dark Spot.",
      "Neptune cannot be seen without a large telescope and was first seen in 1846 from the observatory in Berlin. BUT, the existence of Neptune had actually been âdiscoveredâ a year earlier, in 1845. Neptune is the 8th planet from the Sun. Uranus, the 7th planet, was first discovered by means of a telescope in 1781.",
      "Neptune's atmosphere, like Jupiter's and Saturn's, is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen; it contains a higher proportion of ices such as water, ammonia, and methane.",
      "That reservoir later became known as the Oort cloud. Earlier, in 1943, astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth had suggests comets and larger bodies might exist beyond Neptune. In 1951, astronomer Gerard Kuiper predicted the existence of a belt of icy objects that now bears his name.",
      "Many of these can't be seen from the Earth with the Hubble Space Telescope, but large changes in the atmosphere of Neptune are visible. As with Uranus, the color of Neptune is due to methane in its atmosphere, even though the main components of the atmosphere are hydrogen and helium.",
      "by Fraser Cain on November 27, 2008. The color of Neptune is a bright azure blue. During its flyby in 1989, NASAâs Voyager 2 revealed the bright blue color, different from the pale blue color of Uranus.mage credit: NASA. The answer to Neptuneâs color comes from its cloud tops. The upper atmosphere of Neptune is made up of 80% hydrogen, 19% helium with a trace 1% amount of methane and other ices, like ammonia and water.",
      "When the spacecraft visited the Neptunian system, Neptune was the farthest known body in the Solar system. It was not until 1999, that Pluto was further from the Sun in its trajectory. Voyager 2 studied Neptune's atmosphere, Neptune's rings, its magnetosphere, and Neptune's moons. The Neptunian system had been studied scientifically for many years with telescopes and indirect methods, but the close inspection by the Voyager 2 probe settled many issues and revealed a plethora of information that could not have been obtained otherwise.",
      "NASA's Voyager 2 satellite was the first and as yet only spacecraft to visit Neptune on Aug. 25, 1989. The satellite discovered Neptune's rings and six of the planet's moons â Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Naiad, Proteus and Thalassa. An international team of astronomers relying on ground telescopes announced the discovery of five new moons orbiting Neptune in 2003.",
      "Climate Myth... Neptune is warming. In April 2007, Heidi Hammel published a study comparing Neptune's brightening to Earth's warming and solar variations. She concluded that while they don't correlate statistically, the patterns are visually compelling and planetary climate changes may be due to solar variations.",
      "The exploration of Neptune has only begun with one spacecraft, Voyager 2 in 1989. Currently there are no approved future missions to visit the Neptunian system. NASA, ESA and also independent academic groups have proposed future scientific missions to visit Neptune.",
      "Uranus (left) , Neptune (right) , and Earth to the same scale. Methane gives Uranus and Neptune their blue color. Neptune's Great Dark Spot is seen in the center of the Neptune image. Uranus and Neptune both have a blue color.Instead of ammonia clouds, their clouds are made of frozen methane crystals because they are much colder than Jupiter and Saturn.ethane gives Uranus and Neptune their blue color.

Neptune's atmosphere is made up predominately of hydrogen and helium, with some methane. The methane is part of what gives Neptune its brilliant blue tint, as it absorbs red light and reflects bluer colors.",
      "As in the case of Uranus, the color is due to methane. Neptune would appear darker than Uranus due to dimmer illumination (greater distance from the Sun). Some of the images of Neptune from the Voyager 2 flyby (in 1989) show a deep blue color, but the colors in those images were enhanced. The actual colors of Uranus and Neptune are quite similar. Pluto (no longer a planet; now classified as a dwarf planet): mostly light brown, with some darker regions."

This may have been a first husband for the future Molly Pitcher, or it may have been a marriage of her mother, also named Mary Ludwig as a widow. In 1777, the younger Mary married William Hays, a barber and an artilleryman.",
      "During the battle a cannonball shot by the enemy flew right between her legs and tore apart the bottom of the skirt she was wearing. She was unharmed. When the war ended, Mary gave birth to a son. William Hays died in 1786 and Mary later married John McCauley. This is why Mary's name is sometimes quoted as Mary Ludwig Hays McCauley.",

After the death of William, Mary remarried another Revolutionary War vet by the name of John McCauley.",
      "However, there are some viable contenders for canonization as the real Molly Pitcher such as a young soldier's wife named Mary Ludwig Hayes. Mary Ludwig, the daughter of German immigrants, had married John Hays, a barber, in 1769. She first entered the war record on June 28, 1778, when she signed up two years after her husband to serve with Capt. Francis Proctor's company in the Pennsylvania Artillery.",
