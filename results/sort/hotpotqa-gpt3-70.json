      "SWOT analysis\nSWOT analysis (alternatively SWOT matrix) is an acronym for \"strengths\", \"weaknesses\", \"opportunities\", and \"threats\" and is a structured planning method that evaluates those four elements of an organization, project or business venture. A SWOT analysis can be carried out for a company, product, place, industry, or person. It involves specifying the objectives of the business venture or project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve that objective. Some authors credit SWOT to Albert Humphrey, who led a convention at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) in the 1960s and 1970s using data from Fortune 500 companies. However, Humphrey himself did not claim the creation of SWOT, and the origins remain obscure. The degree to which the internal environment of the firm matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of strategic fit.",

      "James M. Honeycutt\nJames M. Honeycutt is a Distinguished Professor of Communication Studies at Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge, internationally known for his work in relationship scripts and daydreaming, particularly imagined interaction conflict-linkage theory which explains why it is hard to forget old arguments and relational scripts for the development and maintenance of interpersonal relationships. Instead, conflict may fester within the human mind as people imagine retribution that may or may not occur. One of the common attributes of imagined interactions is \"discrepancy\" where conversations that are imagined in the mind may be quite different from what actually happens in verbal discourse. For example, there is high discrepancy if you imagine that your boss will chastise you for being late in meeting a deadline; but then he/she tells you that they understand the delay because of other pending matters. Research has shown that discrepancy is associated with chronic loneliness and lack of satisfaction in interpersonal relationships.",

      "Cyril Hoyt\nCyril J. Hoyt (November 22, 1905--December 16, 1979), the author of Hoyt's coefficient of reliability, was a long-time member of the University of Minnesota Department of Educational Psychology. His interest in the theory and practice of Education had its roots in his teaching of mathematics and science for Minot Public Schools from 1928 to 1937. He became intensely involved in Educational Research while pursuing higher degrees at the University of Minnesota. Quiet, absorbed in abstract thought during his lectures on the theory of measurement and the theory of scaling, he was self-effacing to the degree that he never mentioned in class his major contribution to psychometrics (Hoyt, 1941), leaving that to others. His modesty is perhaps one of the reasons that the generalization of the Kuder-Richardson's (1937) formulation of the coefficient of internal consistency reliability to a continuous case is generally ascribed to Lee Cronbach (1951), even though Hoyt had already made this generalization a decade earlier (Hoyt, 1941). Professor Hoyt retired in 1974.",

      "Kinky boots\nKinky boots are boots with extreme characteristics which are intended to present a dramatic sexy appearance, such as by a prostitute or dominatrix. Extreme characteristics might include very high heels, thigh- or crotch-high length, or unusual colors or materials. Boots like this can be related to boot fetishism, which thus makes them a form of fetish clothing. The term is ambiguous, since what can be considered kinky by some can be seen as elegant fashion by others.",
      "Chap boot\nChap boots are a form of footwear. They are tall boots which cover the whole leg up to the crotch, with a strap attached to the outer side. These straps consist of a loop of material through which a belt is threaded to hold the boots up. Thus the boots act similarly to a pair of chaps. Such boots are often seen as part of boot fetishism.",

According to Bell: \"Recado is a collection of messages that wind like a long dirt road through the years of my writing. There's the first song I wrote after moving to Austin, written on a whore-house piano that writer-friendly Strait Music sold me for 150 bucks--delivered. There's one about taking chances in Berkeley while I collaborated with Bob Neuwirth on my first album, \"Phoenix\". Two are from the high desert south of Santa Fe, New Mexico where you can see for a hundred miles. I also chose a masterful one from Townes. Altogether they portray at least a couple of lifetimes of lyric like I like it, with music that says the same thing.\"",

Although boots were a popular style of women’s footwear in the Nineteenth Century, they were not recognized as a high fashion item until the 1960s. They became widely popular in the 1970s and have remained a staple of women’s winter wardrobes since then.",

From his mentors and from records he did not so much copy notes as learn sounds and how to make them. He played old-time blues as if he was living in the 1930s, as if this was the music of his day.

      "Green Boots\nGreen Boots is the name given to the unidentified corpse of a climber that became a landmark on the main Northwest ridge route of Mount Everest. Though his identity has not been officially confirmed, he is believed to be Tsewang Paljor, an Indian climber who died on Mount Everest in 1996. The term \"Green Boots\" originated from the green mountaineering boots the body wore. All expeditions from the north side encountered the body curled in the limestone alcove cave at 8500 m . In 2006, a different climber, David Sharp, died during a solo climb in what is known as \"Green Boots' Cave\". His plight may have been overlooked by those who did not see him or by those who saw him there but did not stop to investigate, as they either mistakenly believed him to be Green Boots, to have already died, or to be merely resting.

      "Back to Mono (1958–1969)\nBack to Mono (1958–1969) is a box set (4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs) compilation of the recorded work of record producer Phil Spector, through the 1960s, released in 1991 by ABKCO as #7118-2. The first track, \"To Know Him Is to Love Him,\" released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears. Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, \"The First Tycoon of Teen.\" The package also contained a small, round, red \"Back to Mono\" pin.",
      "Mono Masters\nMono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album \"Past Masters\". \"Mono Masters\" was originally a two-CD set included as part of \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set. The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version). As a result, the track listing for \"Mono Masters\" differs from \"Past Masters\" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (\"Old Brown Shoe\", \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Let It Be\"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes. Tracks 9–12 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7\" mono \"Yellow Submarine\" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered. Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or \"fold-down\", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased. \"Get Back\" (with B-side \"Don't Let Me Down\") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format. It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo. Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release.",

The album was untitled and released on both CD and 7\" vinyl formats, also in Europe on Broken Glasses Records (distributed by NO PANIC! Records now). All formats are out of print and difficult to find. The song \"Wreck Your Life\" was later released on a label sampler cd from Trustkill, the label that This Is Hell later signed to and released their debut full length \"Sundowning,\" but not before a stint on State On Mind Recordings who released their self-titled EP. On that same song, the opening line of the lyric includes the band's name, and was possibly the inspiration for the name. The lyric reads: \"Brandon put it best when he told me 'this is hell,' wiser words have never been said.\"",
      "It Ain't Over...\nIt Ain't Over is an album by the British band The Outfield, released to their fan club. It was their first album of all new material for six years, since 1992's \"Rockeye\", and was also their debut album on the 'Warning Tracks' label. (With the exception of the title track \"It Ain't Over,\" all of the songs also appear on the subsequent release \"Extra Innings\".) Dave Harris, who managed the band in 1998, and host of Retro rewind revealed this on his show in 2004: \"A lot of the songs on \"It Ain't Over\" were from the archives. These were songs that John and Tony had recorded years earlier and I convinced them to gather them so that we can go through them and put it out for eager fans. John and I chose the songs for release, a process that took a few months. We mastered them in Nashville in August 1998 and decided to release it on our own label. We printed up about 2000 copies and sold them at the shows on the 'It Ain't Over tour' in 1998. So needless to say this incarnation of the CD is a collectors item.\"",

      "Yes I Will\n\"Yes I Will\", also known as \"I'll Be True to You\", is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Russ Titelman. The song was first recorded in 1964 by British Beat group The Hollies who released it as a single in January 1965 where it peaked at number 9 in the United Kingdom. Two versions of this song were released by the Hollies. An alternate take with prominent acoustic guitars and a different intro was included on the band's 1968 Greatest Hits album in the UK since the original single version was only available as a mono mix, and EMI wanted all tracks in stereo, for which only the alternate take existed. This is often described as an \"erroneous\" version because it does not reflect what was heard on the single. Other examples of this practice include Stay from 1963 in which the famous guitar solo in the middle-eight was recorded live as the mono mix was being made, meaning the stereo version has a different solo, the one that was previously recorded on the multi-(4) track studio tape. A version of the song titled \"I'll Be True to You\" was recorded by The Monkees and included on their 1966 self-titled debut album. Australia's Twilights also recorded a version on their eponymous 1966 album.",

This combining of artists and mediums initially took the form of a series that Monofonus Press dubbed the \"IF Series\". In general these releases have taken the form of a short story, a musical album, and visual art in the forms of illustrations in the book and cover art for the small book and the album. The short story that was published in IF02, \"Captioning for the Blind\" by Rebbecca Bengal, was selected to be included in collection \"Best non-required reading 2009\". At the time of this writing there have been eight IF series produced. In 2009, Monofonus Press Co-produced a micro budget film by Bryan Poyser, titled \"Lovers of Hate\". The movie was one of twelve selected to compete in the 2010 Sundance dramatic competition. In addition to financially supporting the film, Monofonus Press created a short non-fiction comic book, which was made up of a series of short interviews with twelve of the creators of the movie.

Going for a British sound, Bergen started with a chord progression based on The Beatles’ “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and Coburn added a lyric. The writers did not receive the usual $25 or $50 advance, but the company did pay for a one-hour demo recording which took place with studio players including Frank Owens (piano) and Kenny Karen (vocals). The session ended early so producer Ken Lauber spent the final ten minutes changing the original uptempo concept to a ballad approach. He asked Karen to do his best Jerry Butler impression, and asked Owens to play the way he had on the Dionne Warwick records (that piano part is still copied today on many of the newer versions of the song.) The next day, at Coburn’s suggestion, the writers took the demo to Hy Weiss at Old Town Records for jazz singer Arthur Prysock.

      "These Guys Are from England and Who Gives a Shit\nThese Guys Are from England and Who Gives a Shit is the 2001 re-release of the \"U2\" EP by Negativland. It contains both tracks from the original EP, plus some tracks from the 1989 \"Over the Edge\" broadcasts on which the original EP was based, as well as live tracks recorded at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. The album was called a \"bootleg\" and released under \"Seelard Records\" as a joke, but in fact it was a real release by the band. Several of the live tracks on the album contain the same samples of a profane Casey Kasem as had appeared on the \"U2\" EP set to a different musical arrangement, which includes a spoken portion which in part borrows from the lyrics of \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". Other live tracks made reference to the band's battle with SST Records and to the 1960 U-2 incident.",

      "Astro Launch\nAstro Launch is one of many 7\" EPs Man or Astro-man? released in 1994. It was released on Estrus Records on clear orange vinyl and black vinyl. As the black vinyl copies are pressed onto translucent black vinyl, some discographies list the vinyl color as \"rootbeer\" or \"clear rootbeer\". There are also some copies pressed on opaque gray vinyl, and at least one copy on dark, ruby-red vinyl. \"Transmission from Venus '94\" is a re-recording of a song Man or Astro-man? recorded in 1993 and released on a Roger Corman tribute compilation.

      "Orthophonic Joy\nOrthophonic Joy: The 1927 Bristol Sessions Revisited is a double-CD produced by Grammy Award-winner Carl Jackson, a Bluegrass and Country music artist, as a benefit for the Birthplace of Country Music Museum in Bristol, Tennessee. The project was conceived by executive producer Rusty Morrell, a Bristol native who was well acquainted with the story of the historic 1927 Bristol Sessions and imagined a modern tribute to the sessions that have been dubbed the 'big bang' of Country Music. The project includes 37 tracks - 18 songs and 19 spoken word tracks that provide context. WSM disc jockey and country music historian Eddie Stubbs narrates the project, and a who's who of country artists recorded the new versions of the old classics. Jackson recorded the album between 2013 and 2015. It was released by Sony Legacy Recordings on May 12, 2015.",

      "Back in Black (song)\n\"Back in Black\" is a song by AC/DC, appearing as the first track on side two of their 1980 album of the same name. Known for its opening guitar riff, the song was AC/DC's tribute to their former singer Bon Scott. His replacement Brian Johnson recalled to \"Mojo\" magazine in 2009 that when the band asked him to write a lyric for this song, \"they said, 'it can't be morbid – it has to be for Bon and it has to be a celebration.'\" He added: \"I thought, 'Well no pressure there, then' (laughs). I just wrote what came into my head, which at the time seemed like mumbo, jumbo. 'Nine lives. Cats eyes. Abusing every one of them and running wild.' The boys got it though. They saw Bon's life in that lyric.\" It peaked in the U.S. at No. 37 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in 1981 and was No. 51 on Billboard's Top Tracks chart, which debuted in March 1981. \"Back in Black\" received the RIAA's Master Ringtone Sales Award (Gold and Platinum) in 2006 and reached 2× Platinum status in 2007.",
      "God Is Dead?\n\"God Is Dead?\" is a song by heavy metal band Black Sabbath featured on the album \"13\". It is the first single from the album, and the first with Ozzy Osbourne since 1998's \"Psycho Man\" and \"Selling My Soul\" from \"Reunion\". The song was released via an MP3 download on Amazon. It was also available as a free download to those who pre-ordered the full album on iTunes. The song in its entirety was posted on the official YouTube channel in promotion of this. Both the song title and figure on the single's cover, by Heather Cassils, are a reference to Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher who is famous for saying that \"God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?\".",
      "I Won't Let You Walk Away\nThe song is a vocal version of the instrumental single by Mako called \"Sunburst\" released in 2014. Alex Seaver of Mako said in an interview \"I had bought this $45 Fender guitar in Glendale and just started tracking some stuff, and that turned into “Sunburst” — the instrumental. We put that up just as a nice, fun summer tune and everybody was just like we want to hear a vocal over it. We had never considered it. The second they said it, it seemed like, 'Oh, this would be a great idea'. Why not? We knew what kind of song we wanted at that point, because the track sounds a certain way. As soon as we got Madison on it, it came to life really easily because the sound is perfect for her voice, for the style, the writing and the track. It was just a great fit.\".",
      "A-side and B-side\nThe terms A-side and B-side refer to the two sides of 78, 45, and 33 1/3 rpm phonograph records, whether singles, extended plays (EPs), or long-playing (LP) records. The A-side usually featured the recording that the artist, record producer, or the record company intended to receive the initial promotional effort and then receive radio airplay, hopefully, to become a \"hit\" record. The B-side (or \"flip-side\") is a secondary recording that has a history of its own: some artists released B-sides that were considered as strong as the A-side and became hits in their own right. Others took the opposite approach: producer Phil Spector was in the habit of filling B-sides with on-the-spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the A-side. With this practice, Spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side.",
      "Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder\nDarkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder is a first-person 3D adventure / horror thriller video game. It takes place in an imaginary \"Lovecraftian\" place called Wellsmoth. As police detective Howard E. Loreid, players are tasked to solve the murder of Clark Field, a wealthy man involved in the occult. At the top of your list of suspects is Loath Nolder, a highly respected private investigator who mysteriously abandoned his last case for reasons unknown. Rumor had it that he ventured to several exotic places around the world. It remains a great mystery as to why Loath Nolder disappeared so suddenly, resurfacing five years later and resuming his investigations just as abruptly as he had left them. Why does this venerated P.I. now sit on the other side of the law?",
      "The Alan Parsons Project That Never Was\nEric Woolfson sings The Alan Parsons Project That Never Was is an album by the progressive rock musician Eric Woolfson, co-creator with Alan Parsons of The Alan Parsons Project, as well as main songwriter and manager of the band. Released in 2009, this was Woolfson's final album before he died of cancer in December of that year. The album includes songs that remained unreleased since the Project time for various reasons; however, as Woolfson himself remarks in the booklet, Parsons' dislike for some of Woolfson's compositions would have often caused them to be excluded from a Project album in its very early stages - such as, for example, \"Steal Your Heart Away\", an \"unashamedly commercial\" song with a conventionally sentimental lyric, which Parsons, in Woolfson's words, would have absolutely detested. \"Somewhere in the Audience\" and \"Immortal\" are slightly re-arranged and re-recorded versions of two of Woolfson's demos for his 2003 musical about Edgar Allan Poe; the final versions of these songs, sung by the musical's protagonist Steve Balsamo, are featured on the album \"\". \"Train to Wuxi\" was the original version of \"Train to Freedom\", which is also included (with different lyrics) in the Poe musical and features Woolfson's one and only guitar solo.",
      "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\n\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\" is a song by the Beatles released on their 1968 album \"The Beatles\", commonly referred to as \"the White Album\". It was written and sung by Paul McCartney, but credited to Lennon–McCartney. \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\" is short and simple; 1:42 of twelve-bar blues that begins with three different percussion elements (a hand banging on the back of an acoustic guitar, handclaps, and drums) and features McCartney's increasingly raucous vocal repeating a simple lyric with only two different lines.",

Speiden fought in both World Wars, attended Yale and received a letter for football while playing on the hockey team, taught in China, worked on Wall Street, and bought a ranch. He ran for Congress for the 2nd District of Arizona in 1956 and 1958, defeated by Stewart Udall both times. Charlie Ohrel, who inherited most of the information about Jack, after his death, summed up his life with a humorous understatement; \"He sure did give it a good shot.\" Speiden's ranch, the Jay Six Ranch, left a legacy of its own. The ranch played host to political figures like the young brothers Joseph & John Kennedy, and to senior statesman Barry Goldwater. The Kennedy brothers (Joe age 21 and John age 19) were sent out to the 40000 acre Jay Six Ranch in 1936 so that Jack Kennedy could recuperate in the dry desert heat. It is reported that Speiden worked them both \"very hard\".",

Like his first two books, it features Inspector Hazlerigg, although not in a major role. It is, in fact, a very diffuse book in terms of its characters. Angus McMann, who was the chief protagonist of Gilbert's previous book, They Never Looked Inside, is briefly mentioned on the first page and makes a later appearance as a minor character. Hazlerigg does not appear until page 24 and thereafter only at intervals throughout the book. There are, in actuality, three other protagonists who, along with Hazlerigg, share the role of driving the narrative. One is Noel Anthony Pontarlier Rumbold (\"Nap\"), a junior solicitor in his father's London firm. Nap had spent four months on dangerous missions with the French maquis in occupied France during the war and is, apparently, still a Lieutenant-Colonel, D.S.O. A few years later he will be a main character in Gilbert's well-received novel \"Death Has Deep Roots\". Patrick (Paddy) Yeatman-Carter, an acquaintance of Nap's, is another lead character, as is his uncle, Alfred Lord Cedarbrook, a man with an astonishing background, much sought after by both the Foreign Office and the War Office during WWII and now, apparently, still affiliated with the Secret Service. As well as being a linguist, explorer, soldier, and diplomat, he also has a law degree. All three of them, to one degree or another, carry out private investigations, sometimes with the backing of Hazlerigg, sometimes not.",

He maintained a long and close friendship with Arthur Rimbaud with whom he first met in April 1865 when they attended school together in Charleville in the Ardennes region of France.

      "Jacques-Louis Copia\nJacques-Louis Copia, a French engraver, was born at Landau in 1764. He went to Paris, and among other plates executed a charming little portrait of Queen Marie Antoinette, after Piauger, which is very rare. He also engraved a head of Marat, terribly startling in its ghastliness, from a drawing made by David immediately after his assassination. But Copia is chiefly identified with Prud'hon, the voluptuous genius of whose works no one has more fully comprehended. It must, however, be admitted that, apart from the great painter, Copia would have remained hidden in the crowd. His style was neither original nor brilliant, and his rare qualities of modelling and softness of execution required works suitable for their display. He died in Paris in 1799, unfortunately too early to be able to engrave the greatest works of his friend. But among other pupils he left one, Roger, who caught his manner, and is thought by many to have surpassed his master in the interpretation of the spirit of Prud'hon.",

Ronsard began writing the poem in the 1540s for Henry II of France, but it was only in 1572 that the poet published, now for Charles IX, the first four books of a planned twenty-four. Various reasons have been given to explain why the poem was never finished. Obviously, the death of his dedicatee Charles IX meant that Ronsard would have to have made certain changes. Another factor might have been the verse form: Ronsard wrote in decasyllables, not alexandrines. Other reasons, too, have been put forward. More recently, it has been stated that \"[any] attempt to pin down why the Franciade was left unfinished, while potentially interesting, probably futile\" and that \"we must read it despite [the fact it is unfinished], not as a fragment of what might have been, but as a text in its own right\"",

Frequently changing hands among the British, French and Spanish, the rules were often confusing, and Joseph managed to be on many sides of an issue. As an example, in his last letter before his tragic suicide, Meriwether Lewis wrote to Thomas Jefferson:“On my way to St. Louis, last fall, I received satisfactory evidence that a Mr. Robideau [sic], an inhabitant of St. Louis, had, the preceding winter, during intercourse with the Ottoes and Missouris, been guilty of the most flagrant breaches of the first of those misdemeanors above mentioned...And Mr. Robidoux and sons still prosecute their trade.” On 21 September 1782, Joseph married Catherine Marie Rollet (1767-1798). Joseph and Catherine had nine children, eight of which lived to adulthood:",
      "Hob Broun\nHob Broun (born Heywood Orren Broun; 1950 in Manhattan, New York, U.S. - December 16, 1987, Portland, Oregon, U.S.) was an author who lived in Portland, Oregon. Following the publication of his first novel, \"Odditorium\", Broun required a spinal surgery to remove a tumor that ultimately saved his life but resulted in his paralysis. Subsequently, he wrote two books by blowing air through a tube that activated the specially outfitted keyboard of a computer. Using this technology, he completed a second novel, \"Inner Tube\", and wrote the short stories contained in a posthumously published collection entitled \"Cardinal Numbers\" which won an Oregon Book Award in 1989. He was working on a third novel when he died of asphyxiation after his respirator broke down in his home. He was thirty-seven years old.",
      "George de Zayas\nGeorge de Zayas (1898–1967), a Mexican caricature artist, best known for work that appeared in \"Collier's\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", and the magazine section of the \"New York Herald Tribune\". His father, Rafael de Zayas Enriquez (1848–1932), was a noted historian, orator, and lawyer, named Poet Laureate of his country. In 1907, opposition to the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz forced the de Zayas family to flee their homeland and settle in New York. There, George's brother, Marius de Zayas (1880–1961), became a well-known caricature artist and art dealer. At the age of 16, George left for Paris to study art, where he met some of the most important artists of the day. In 1919, he contributed eleven caricatures to the portfolio by Curnonsky, pseudonym of the French writer Maurice Edmond Sailland (1872–1956), who later became a well-known food critic. The portfolio was entitled \"Huit Peintres, deux sculpteurs et un musician tres modernes\". The eight painters mentioned in the title were Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Henri Matisse, Marie Laurencin, Jean Metzinger, Francis Picabia, Pablo Picasso and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes; the sculptors Alexander Archipenko and Constantin Brâncuși; and the musician Eric Satie. It was also while living in Paris that de Zayas gave Marcel Duchamp a comet-shaped tonsure which was photographed by Man Ray, an image that has often been reproduced in the literature on this famous French artist. De Zayas returned to the United States in 1926, where he worked for a variety of magazines on a free-lance basis. In 1933, he designed the Huey Long Medal, and in 1938, joined the Artists Guild, where, for a brief period, he served as president. He ended his career as a commercial photographer, working for many years for the International Division of RCA."

      "Tennis male players statistics\nSince 1983, men's tennis has had a very strong tradition and clear hierarchy of tournaments: (1) Grand Slam tournaments, including Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open; (2) the Tennis Masters Cup; and (3) the Davis Cup. Before 1983, however, and in particular before the start of the open era in 1968, the hierarchy of professional tournaments changed virtually every year. For example, in 1934, the U.S. Pro was a high-class tournament with all the best players, but just two years later, this tournament was ordinary because only professional teachers (no leading touring pros) entered the event.",
      "Wimbledon Effect\nThe Wimbledon effect (Japanese: ウィンブルドン現象, rōmaji: \"Uinburudon Genshō\", literally \"Wimbledon Phenomenon\") is a chiefly British and Japanese analogy (which possibly originated in Japan) which compares the tennis fame of the Wimbledon Championships, held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, with the economic success of the United Kingdom's financial services industries – especially those clustered in the City of London. The point of the analogy is that a national and international institution (the All England Club) can be highly successful despite the lack of strong native competition, as in modern tennis Britain has produced very few Wimbledon champions, with only Ann Haydon Jones, Virginia Wade (both women's singles), Jonathan Marray (men's doubles), Andy Murray (men's singles), John Lloyd, Jeremy Bates, Jo Durie, Jamie Murray and Heather Watson (mixed doubles) winning titles in the Open Era.",

      "Tweener (tennis)\nThe tweener or between-the-legs shot is a difficult tennis shot where a player hits the ball between his or her legs. It is typically performed facing away from the opponent, when the player attempts to recover a lob and has no time to turn back around, and hits the ball backward between their legs. Forward-facing tweeners, sometimes called \"front tweeners\", are also occasionally employed. In competitive matches the tweener is a crowd-pleasing, seldom used last resort, but it is a common trick shot in exhibitions. Players who famously executed the backward shot include Guillermo Vilas (whose version was called the \"Gran Willy\"), Yannick Noah, Ilie Nastase, Gabriela Sabatini, Roger Federer, Juan Martín del Potro, Nick Kyrgios and Agnieszka Radwańska.",

His younger brother was tennis and badminton player Henri Pellizza. Allison Danzig of The New York Times said of Pierre Pellizza \"Pellizza was a bulldog for tenacity.

At the French Championships, Pellizza reached the quarter finals in 1946 (where he lost to Tom Brown) and 1947 (where he beat 8th seed Enrique Morea before losing to Tom Brown). At Wimbledon his best performance was in 1946, when he reached the quarter finals (he came from 2 sets down to beat Dragutin Mitić before losing to Jaroslav Drobny). At the U. S.

      "Erika (given name)\nThe given name Erika, or Erica, is a feminine form of Eric, deriving from the Old Norse name \"Eiríkr\" (or \"Eríkr\" in Eastern Scandinavia due to monophthongization). The first element, \"ei-\" is derived either from the older Proto-Norse \"*aina(z)\", meaning \"one, alone, unique\", as in the form \"Æinrikr\" explicitly, or from \"*aiwa(z)\" \"long time, eternity\". The second element \"-ríkr\" stems either from \"*ríks\" \"king, ruler\" (cf. Gothic \"reiks\") or from the therefrom derived \"*ríkijaz\" \"kingly, powerful, rich\". The name is thus usually taken to mean \"sole ruler, autocrat\" or \"eternal ruler, ever powerful\".",

Erika was the eighth tropical cyclone, fifth tropical storm, and third hurricane of the season. At first, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) operationally did not designate it as a hurricane because initial data suggested winds of 70 mph (115 km/h) at Erika's peak intensity. It was not until later data was analyzed that the NHC revised it to Category 1 intensity in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm developed from a non-tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14. Under the influence of a high pressure system, Erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under favorable conditions. It made landfall as a hurricane on northeastern Mexico on August 16 and rapidly dissipated inland.",

Surnames are inherited from the parents, in the order of \"same as elder sibling, if any; specified by parents; or mother's last name,\" while given names must be chosen by the parents at birth.

In contexts where the full name is spelled out, the calling name is often indicated by an asterisk, by capital letters, or underlines or italics.

      "Filipino name\nIn the Philippines, varying naming customs are observed, whether it is given name first, family name last, a mixture of native conventions with those of neighbouring territories, etc. The most common iteration amongst Filipinos is a blend of the older Spanish system and Anglo-American conventions, where there is a distinction between the \"Christian name\" from \"surname\". The construct of having several names in the middle name convention is common to all systems, but to have multiple \"first\" names and only one middle and last name is a result of the blending of American and Spanish naming customs. The Tagalog language is one of the few national languages in Asia to use the Western name order. Thus, the Philippine naming custom is coincidentally identical to the Portuguese name customs.",

      "Spanish naming customs\nSpanish naming customs are historical traditions for naming children practised in Spain. According to these customs, a person's name consists of a given name (simple or composite) followed by two family names (surnames). The first surname is usually the father's first surname, and the second the mother's first surname. In recent years, the order of the surnames can be decided at birth. Often, the practice is to use one given name and the first surname only (e.g. Miguel de Unamuno), with the full name being used in legal, formal, and documentary matters, or for disambiguation when the first surname is very common (e.g. Federico García Lorca, Gabriel García Márquez).",

      "Mach Breakers: Numan Athletics 2\nMach Breakers: Numan Athletics 2 (マッハブレイカーズ: ニューマンアスレチックス 2 , Mahha Bureikāzu: Nyūman Asurechikkusu Tsu ) is a sports arcade game that was released by Namco in 1994 only in Japan; it runs on Namco NB-2 hardware and is the sequel to \"Numan Athletics\", which was released in the previous year. The players must take control of up to seven new (and selectable) Numans - Masala T. (Tikka) Masala (India, born in 1800), Johnny Sanders (United States, born on 7 August 1969), Makoto Kotobuki (Japan, born on 10 October 1975), Sophia Rayleigh (United Kingdom, born on 14 July 1970), Long Rui Huan (Communist China, born on 1 January 1953), Michael Fletcher (Jamaica, born on 25 September 1966), and, Karl Weisemann (Germany, born on 9 May 1957). All seven of these new Numans have different speed and power levels, and if less than four players are present, the CPU will randomly select up to three of the other Numans to compete against them (but they will be differently-coloured); the competition takes place over five days, and on the second, third and fourth ones, there are three (four on the third day) different events that must be qualified for. If any player fails to qualify for an event on these days, they will have to try it again by inserting another coin and continuing - and each of the Numans has their own unique ending sequence (much like the four lords from \"Exvania\"), which means a player will have to finish the game with all seven of them to see them all. The starter lights on the \"Hyper Glider\" event also look like Pac-Man, and a picture of him also appears on the side of a passing airship (along with: Prince Gilgamesh and Princess Ki from \"The Tower of Druaga\", Momo Chan out of \"Wonder Momo\", Valkyrie out of \"Valkyrie no Densetsu\", Hiromi Tengenji from \"Burning Force\" and Pitt and Patti from \"Tinkle Pit\") - while Miyuki Chan (from \"Ordyne\") can get seen running a \"Prince Paco\" (from \"Marvel Land\") taco stand, and the \"Dig Dug\" characters can be seen in the \"Ground Spike\" event as the crack a Numan makes in the ground goes deeper.",

Their final EP 333 was released in April 2013 alongside a documentary of their final tour, entitled \"If We Shout Loud Enough\".",

He hired Indianapolis architect Henry Dupont to design the hotel and Carlton Beard as contractor. To ensure the stability of the hotel on the shifting sand and avoid the high cost of sinking so many pilings, Beard devised a floating concrete pad and pyramid footings. To this day there is no sign of evident settling of the hotel. The architecture is a blend of Mediterranean and Moorish styles modeled after different hotels and developments that Rowe and Beard saw in Palm Beach, Coral Gables and Boca Raton. Arched openings, red clay tile roofs, balconies, stucco over hollow tile and tower like upper stories were some of the elements that they borrowed. The original design called for a $450,000 six-story hotel with 110 rooms and baths. It was later expanded to 220 rooms and 220 baths and the costs soared to $1.25 million, 300% over budget.

Such was the case of Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy (1792–1862), a Sephardic Jew of Hispanic descent and great grandson of Dr. Samuel Nunez, who served in the War of 1812. During the American Civil War, the government of the United States recognized that the rapid expanding Navy was in need of admirals therefore, Congress proceeded to authorize the appointment of nine officers the rank of rear admiral. On July 16, 1862, Flag Officer David Glasgow Farragut became the first Hispanic-American to be appointed to the rank of rear admiral. Two years later (1864), Farragut became a vice admiral, and in 1866 the Navy's first full admiral. During World War I, Robert Lopez, the first Hispanic graduate of the United States Naval Academy, served with the rank of commodore in command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and during World War II five Hispanics served with the ranks of rear admiral or above in either the European or Pacific Theater's of the war.

Ellis begins by saying people had not been able to have an efficient comprehensive study of men and women before him. The \"Dictionary of National Biography\" had a large collection of descriptions of people, but it had been too unwieldy and large to be useful. Ellis then analyzes people and their natural tendencies to contribute successfully to society, but people born into royalty are excluded. They cannot be included with the rest of the population because they were given advantages at a young age that others were not given. The term genius is used to describe intelligence every time the word is mentioned throughout the text. He examines the concept of tracking down the origin of intelligence to a specific region of the world. In order to do this, each person must be asked about their birthplace to create an accurate record. The best way of asking though, is to ask each grandparent where they came from. In the chapter on social class, to determine the social class of people most precisely, it was best to ask the fathers what their occupation was.

It was promoted by Samuel Carter Hall, George Dawson and John Passmore Edwards, among others. Half-day early Closing was not finally won until 1912. It was opposed by Asquith's Liberal Government until a bill could be passed due to Trade Union pressure. The first socialist woman to enter parliament Margaret Bondfield, later a Labour MP, was an early advocate of early closing when a mass meeting was held in Trafalgar Square. But it would be another decade of 72 hour working days before the week could be cut to 60 hours. Another radical supporter was disgraced Liberal MP Sir Charles Dilke, whose involvement with Mrs Crawford damaged his reputation and chances of becoming Prime Minister. Had he become Gladstone's natural successor early closing might have happened in 1890. Dilke's bill to close shops at 8 pm which failed to pass was bitterly opposed by both Lords and Commons during 1903. Home Secretary Winston Churchill was very anti-trade union regularly opposing any legislation to assist the improvements they so desired. Other famous supporters included H.G. Wells, the author who had spent a miserable two years behind the counter. The creator of Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle warmly approved of the Early Closing Association. Church leaders and friendly societies also backed a change in the law. Without statutory control exploitative proprietors could keep shops open until midnight at the weekend.",

      "The Man Who Could Not Sleep and Other Mysteries\nThe Man Who Could Not Sleep and Other Mysteries is a collection of radio plays by the British thriller writer Michael Gilbert, first published in 2011 by the British company Robert Hale and unpublished in the United States. It contains two long, previously uncollected radio plays, as well as synopses of two proposed stage plays that were never subsequently written. It also has an introduction by John Cooper and three appendices. The locales of the plays are mostly in London and its environs. Two of the many recurring characters that Gilbert created over his exceedingly long writing career, Nap Rumbold and Hargest Macrea, are in \"The Game Called Justice\". As usual with Gilbert, the tone of the stories is civilized and even occasionally light-hearted, but there are always elements of bleakness beneath the urbane surface, particularly in \"The Last Chapter\". \"Michael was an exceptionally fine storyteller, but he's hard to classify,\" said one of his American publishers after his death. \"He's not a hard-boiled writer in the classic sense, but there is a hard edge to him, a feeling within his work that not all of society is rational, that virtue is not always rewarded.\". Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award.",

      "Agatha Christie bibliography\nAgatha Christie (1890–1976) was an English crime novelist, short story writer and playwright. Although she wrote six romance novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott, her reputation rests on the 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections that she wrote under her own name, which have sold over two billion copies—an amount only surpassed by the Bible and the works of William Shakespeare. Her works contain several regular characters with whom the public became familiar, including Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, Parker Pyne and Harley Quin. Christie wrote more Poirot stories than any of the others, even though she thought the character to be \"rather insufferable\". Following the publication of the 1975 novel \"Curtain\", Poirot's obituary appeared on the front page of \"The New York Times\". The literary historian Howard Haycraft considered that \"few fictional sleuths can surpass the amazing little Belgian—with his waxed moustache and egg-shaped head, his inflated confidence in the infallibility of his 'little grey cells', his murderous attacks on the English language—either for individuality or ingenuity.\"",

      "Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris\nThus Rudyard Kipling introduces, in the story \"The Three Musketeers\" (1888) three characters who were to reappear in many stories, and to give their name to his next collection \"Soldiers Three\". Their characters are given in the sentence that follows: \"Collectively, I think, but am not certain, they are the worst men in the regiment so far as genial blackguardism goes\"—that is, they are 'trouble' to authority, and always on the lookout for petty gain; but Kipling is at pains never to suggest that they are evil or immoral. They are representative of the admiration he has for the British Army—which he never sought to idealise as in any way perfect—as in the poems collected in \"Barrack-Room Ballads\" (1892), and also show his interest in, and respect for the 'uneducated' classes. Kipling has great respect for the independence of mind, initiative and common sense of the three—and their cunning.",

Or the one who smiled when I shared my candy with him? I wondered if I grew up like him, would I have turned out the same?”\"",

      "Dissident republican\nDissident republicans, renegade republicans, anti-Agreement republicans or anti-ceasefire republicans (Irish: \"poblachtach easaontach\" ) are Irish republicans who do not support the current peace agreements in Northern Ireland. The agreements followed a 30-year conflict known as the Troubles, which claimed over 3,500 lives. During the conflict, republican paramilitary groups such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army waged a campaign to bring about a united Irish republic. Peace negotiations in the 1990s led to an IRA ceasefire in 1994 and to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Mainstream republicans, represented by Sinn Féin, supported the Agreement as a means of achieving Irish unity peacefully. 'Dissidents' saw this as an abandonment of republican ideals and acceptance of partition and British rule.

Its earliest use was to describe individual political radicals unconnected with any party and espousing a more \"advanced nationalism\" than the Irish Home Rule movement. In the 1890s \"Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin amháin\" was the slogan of the Gaelic League, which advocated the revival of the Irish language.",

RSF claims to be heirs of the Sinn Féin party founded in 1905 and took its present form in 1986 following a split in Sinn Féin. RSF members take seats when elected to local Irish councils but do not recognise the validity of the partition of Ireland and subsequently the legitimacy of the Northern Ireland (Stormont) or Republic of Ireland (Leinster House) parliaments, so the party does not register itself with them.",
      "Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949\nDuring the period from December 1936 to April 1949, some commentators consider that it was unclear whether or not the Irish state was a republic or a form of constitutional monarchy and (from 1937) whether its head of state was the President of Ireland or King George VI. The exact constitutional status of the state during this period has been a matter of scholarly and political dispute. The Oireachtas removed all references to the monarch from the revised constitution in 1936, but under statute law the British monarch continued to play a role in foreign relations, though always on the advice of the Irish government. A republic was not explicitly declared until 1949.",

      "Liam Mac an Ultaigh\nLiam Mac an Ultaigh of Dublin (fl. c. 1965) is an Irish Nationalist and was Chief Scout of the Fianna Éireann from 1965. In such tenure, Mac an Ultaigh is most recognized for his work on the Committee that under his administration drafted the Fianna Handbook’s 3rd or 1965 (1st 1913, 2nd 1924) edition, which uniquely of the editions attempts to chronicle the organization’s history. Notably, this thorough and well documented Handbook history conclusively disputes traditional histories, which credit the Irish Republican Brotherhood’s Bulmer Hobson with founding the “Scouts” and exposes a, possible, anti-feminist bias in the traditional histories. The 3rd Handbook in its section “The History and Tradition of the Fianna Éireann” at its pages 24–26 credits instead the Sinn Féin’s Constance Markievicz or “the Countess Markievicz” with founding “Na Fianna Éireann”. As already noted in the Wikipedia article Fianna Éireann, Patrick Pearse has stated that the creation of Fianna Éireann was historically as important to the liberation of Southern and Western Ireland from British rule and the founding of the Irish Free State and, later, the Republic of Ireland as was the creation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913. The paramilitary Fianna Éireann youth Scouts were involved particularly with gun running commencing with the 1916 Easter Rising and later in combat, particularly in Dublin, during the Civil War period of 1922-1924.",

The Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, which attempted to halt the court case and assign the funds to Bord Cistí Sinn Féin, was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in an important judgement on separation of powers and private property rights. The original action was subsequently decided against Sinn Féin, on the basis that the pre-1923 party was separate from the 1940s party. Most of the disputed funds were consumed by legal costs.",

The Forum was established by Garret FitzGerald, then Taoiseach, under the influence of John Hume, for \"consultations on the manner in which lasting peace and stability can be achieved in a new Ireland through the democratic process\". The Forum was initially dismissed, by Unionists, Sinn Féin, and others, as a nationalist talking-shop. The Forum's report, published on 2 May 1984, listed three possible alternative structures: a unitary state, a federal/confederal state, and joint British/Irish authority. The British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, dismissed the three alternatives one by one at a press conference, each time saying, \"that is out\", in a response that became known as the \"out, out, out\" speech. However, Garret Fitzgerald, who described the Forum's report as \"an agenda not a blueprint\", valued it as establishing a nationalist consensus from which the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement could be framed.",

Mackenzie credited another Comanchero scout named Johnson for finding the camps. Tafoya also participated in the ill-fated Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877. In 1879, he accompanied Lt. John L. Bullis on an expedition into southern New Mexico in pursuit of a band of marauding Lipan and Mescalero Apaches. By the 1880s, he had left Texas and was once again ranching sheep in New Mexico.

      "Delancey Place\nDelancey Place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is a series of nine mostly unconnected side streets in the Rittenhouse area of the city between 17th and 26th streets. It is known for its visual appeal and historical association with the upper class of Philadelphia society. This is especially true of the 1800 and 2000 blocks, lined with Civil War–era mansions that have changed little in appearance over the years. There are similar mansions on other streets in the Rittenhouse area (e.g., Pine, Spruce, and Locust), but many have converted to apartment buildings and those streets have become more urbanized. Delancey Place, on the other hand, is not as busy and is considered to be the most prestigious address in Philadelphia. Some notable residents have included General George Meade (no. 1836) who defeated Lee’s Confederate forces at Gettysburg, the Rosenbach brothers (nos. 2008–2010 Delancey Place) who played a central role in developing the most important collections of rare books in the United States, as well as presidents and CEOs of some of the largest companies in the city and country.

Moore delve into the mysterious life and death of Johnson, an artist whose “world was made up of amazing coincidences, serendipities and karmic gags,” according to Michael Kimmelman of \"The New York Times\".

It was released in 1979, and it was one of only a few non-gaming cartridges ever designed for the 2600. The programming language was superficially similar to dialects of BASIC, but differed in many important aspects. The extremely small RAM size of the Atari 2600, 128 bytes, severely restricted the possibilities of this cartridge for writing programs.",

According to original CommaVid co-owner Irwin Gaines, only 20 cartridges or less of \"Video Life\" were ever made. Editors of \"AtariAge\" estimate approximately 500 cartridges were produced.

He is best known as the creator of the shooter game \"Space Invaders\", released to the public in 1978 by the Taito Corporation of Japan, often credited as the first shoot 'em up and for beginning the golden age of video arcade games. Originally Nishikado wanted to use airplanes as enemies for Space Invaders, but would have encountered problems making them move smoothly due to the limited computing power at the time (the game was based on Intel's 8 bit 8080 microprocessor). Humans would have been easier to render, but management at Taito forbade the use of human targets. Prior to \"Space Invaders\", he was also the designer for many of Taito's earlier hits, including the early team sport games \"Soccer\" and \"Davis Cup\" in 1973, the early scrolling racing video game \"Speed Race\" in 1974, the early dual-stick on-foot multi-directional shooter \"Gun Fight\" in 1975, and the first-person combat flight simulator \"Interceptor\" in 1975.",

The Microvision's combination of portability and a cartridge-based system led to moderate success, with Smith Engineering grossing $15 million in the first year of the system's release. However, very few cartridges, a small screen, and a lack of support from established home video game companies led to its demise in 1981 .

Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely available to the general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.",

The first version of Applesoft was released in 1977 only on cassette tape and lacked proper support for high-resolution graphics. Applesoft II, which was made available on cassette and disk and in the ROM of the Apple II Plus and subsequent models, was released in 1978. It is this latter version, which has some syntax differences from the first as well as support for the Apple II high-resolution graphics modes, that most people mean by the term \"Applesoft\"."

      "Any Human Heart\nAny Human Heart: The Intimate Journals of Logan Mountstuart is a 2002 novel by William Boyd, a British writer. It is written as a lifelong series of journals kept by Mountstuart, a writer whose life (1906–1991) spanned the defining episodes of the 20th century, crossed several continents and included a convoluted sequence of relationships and literary endeavours. Boyd uses the diary form to explore how public events impinge on individual consciousness, so that Mountstuart’s journal alludes almost casually to the war, the death of a prime minister or the abdication of the king. Boyd plays ironically on the theme of literary celebrity, introducing his protagonist to several real writers who are included as characters – a spat with Virginia Woolf in London, a possible sexual encounter with Evelyn Waugh at Oxford, a clumsy exchange with James Joyce in Paris, and a friendship with Ernest Hemingway that spans several years.",

His field of expertise was modern European history, his most notable work being \"A History of the Great War, 1914–18\". He is mainly remembered, however, for the vendetta pursued against him by the novelist Evelyn Waugh, in which Waugh showed his distaste for his former tutor by repeatedly using the name \"Cruttwell\" in his early novels and stories to depict a sequence of unsavoury or ridiculous characters. The prolonged minor humiliation thus inflicted may have contributed to Cruttwell's eventual mental breakdown.",

The result of an interest in psychoanalysis that began when Marcuse suggested to Brown that he should read Freud, \"Life Against Death\" became famous when Norman Podhoretz recommended it to Lionel Trilling. It has been compared to works such as Frankfurt school philosopher Herbert Marcuse's \"Eros and Civilization\" (1955) and philosopher Michel Foucault's \"Madness and Civilization\" (1961).",

However, whereas some of the events, especially those of a sexual nature, were over the head of the eleven-year-old narrator of \"Thanks to My Mother\", Olga Lengyel describes such events with an unflinching gaze.

      "Historical realism\nHistorical realism requires the writer’s critical knowledge of the historicist who has a different interpretation of the historical events. Hegel’s dialectical theory affected many thinkers concerned with social issues. Both realist and modernist writers wanted to reflect the very changes in their societies in their own ways. In that way, history is of great deal to literature and many literary artists preoccupied themselves with historical materials. In the treatment of history, realist writers have accused society, like what the naturalists did, of being the responsible of the confusion and contradiction in which their heroes, often typical for suffering individuals who struggle against the mainstream ideas and wrong, or at least new, beliefs, find themselves. They show us both the environment, factors that affect people and values that dominate the very spirits of the individuals and picture us a typical end they drag themselves to out of their free will which has been affected by what they see and what they come to believe in causing new emergent ideologies and believes that evoke new social formation and raise contradictions as a result of the hegemonic behaviours of the dominant class over the subservient one. Moreover, literary works tend to reflect a specific historical moment that is of great significance to the writer or the world in which he lives.",

In the course of exploring this theme Stern undertakes to provide psychological portraits of six representative figures whose thought and work have influenced modern man: Descartes, Goethe, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, and Sartre.",
      "Literary modernism\nLiterary modernism, or modernist literature, has its origins in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly in Europe and North America, and is characterized by a very self-conscious break with traditional ways of writing, in both poetry and prose fiction. Modernists experimented with literary form and expression, adhering to Ezra Pound's maxim to \"Make it new\". This literary movement was driven by a conscious desire to overturn traditional modes of representation and express the new sensibilities of their time. The horrors of the First World War saw the prevailing assumptions about society reassessed, and modernist writers were influenced by such thinkers as Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx, amongst others, who raised questions about the rationality of the human mind.",

      "Eros and Civilization\nEros and Civilization: A Philosophical Inquiry into Freud (1955; second edition, 1966) is a book by the German philosopher and social critic Herbert Marcuse, in which the author proposes a non-repressive society and attempts a synthesis of the theories of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud; it has been suggested that the work also reveals the influence of Martin Heidegger. The title of \"Eros and Civilization\" alludes to Freud's \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" (1930). One of Marcuse's best known works, and the book with which he achieved international fame, \"Eros and Civilization\" has been compared to books such as Norman O. Brown's \"Life Against Death\" (1959). \"Eros and Civilization\" helped shape the subcultures of the 1960s. The 1966 edition has an added \"political preface\".",

(full title: Who are the Mind Benders?: The people who rule Britain through control of the mass media) is a 1997 publication by Nick Griffin which was printed and distributed by the British National Party. The booklet outlines a Jewish conspiracy whereby Jews control the media in Britain and use this position to brainwash the [white] British population. Griffin claims for instance that Jews are responsible for “providing us with an endless diet of pro-multiracial, pro-homosexual, anti-British trash”. The book is based upon American neo-Nazi Dr William Pierce's work \"Who Rules America?\" and also drew on the anti-Semitic forgery the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". \"Who are the Mind Benders?\" has been criticised for its overtly anti-Semitic content. Prominent Jews mentioned as forming part of a conspiracy include Alan Yentob, Michael Grade, Jeremy Isaacs and the supposedly part-Jewish Rupert Murdoch.",

Set in the 1930s and written in the vein of an Agatha Christie novel, it has all the classic ingredients of a 1930s mystery and is, according to the author, \"at one and the same time, a celebration, a parody and a critique not only of Agatha Christie but of the whole Golden Age of English whodunits\", but also \"a whodunit in its own right, so that those readers who were completely uninterested in literary games of the so-called postmodern type could nevertheless settle down comfortably with a good, gripping and intentionally old-fashioned thriller\". \"The Act of Roger Murgatroyd\" is also a locked room mystery.",

      "Ingrid Bengis\nIngrid Bengis, born in 1944 in New York City, is a writer best known for her pioneering collection of essays on love, hate and sexuality, \"Combat in the Erogenous Zone\", (Knopf 1972). The book received critical acclaim and was nominated for a National Book Award. \"The New York Times Book Review\" said, \"It must be read and it must be taken seriously if human sexuality is ever going to live up to its notices\" while \"Newsweek\" called it \"a remarkable book...that has probably moved both women and men on a deeper level than any other document of the new feminism\". It was reissued in 1990 after Martin Duberman, writing in \"The Village Voice\" asked, \"Where is this astonishing writer? Why has she dropped from sight\". The reissue by Harper Collins included a new introduction by Duberman, in which he wrote, \"(Bengis) was only twenty eight when the book was published, but had lived so intensely and could describe her experiences so freshly...that her ruminations about love, hate and sex struck many of us who were older than she as astonishingly vivid and wise. Nearly twenty years later, they still do.\" Among the most frequently cited quotes from the book are \"Imagination has always had powers of resurrection that no science can match\" and \"For me, words are a form of action, capable of influencing change\", quoted by Barack Obama in one of his 2008 campaign speeches.",

      "The Book of the Book\nThe Book of the Book was and still is a revolutionary book, both challenging for the literary circles and the established thinking pattern which focuses more on the container, than the content. Considered by some as a simple joke, it was mentioned during an epistolar exchange between Doris Lessing and Lawrence Paul Elwell-Sutton in the The New York Review of Books. In such article, the English scholar wrote:Out of nearly 200 pages only nine carry any print at all; the rest are blank. But I suppose his admirers among the Hampstead intelligentsia will have swallowed this buffoonery with the same enthusiasm with which they have gulped down the rest. It’s all very odd. I am disinclined to credit the Shah brothers with hypnotic powers—though anyone who listened, as I did, to the BBC radio program referred to by Doris Lessing might have been forgiven for suspecting something of the kind; I am still amused and amazed when I recall the sycophantic manner of Idries Shah’s interlocutors.",
      "Das dumme Gänslein\nDas dumme Gänslein \"(The Silly Goose)\" is one in a trio of German animated short films produced in 1944 by Hans Fischerkoesen, who was the chief animator and author. It is a tale of a female goose consumed by adventure and urban glamour in her countryside life, who had to be saved from a cunning fox by her friends and family. The moral of the tale was not be extravagant and adventurous due to its consequences and it not being what one would expect, and promoting that people should live a ‘normal’ German family life. The animation has an underling theme of Nazi propaganda. It symbolises the Völkisch ideology to be traditionally conventional, demonstrating the idea that a woman’s main purpose was to produce ‘true’ German children, and not be individualistic or sexually sinful. It represents that if you vary from the traditional German life then the consequences could be dire, possibly leading to death. This can relate to the Nazi fear policy, by which people who opposed the regime or were seen as asocial, were punished and it could have eventually lead to their death. The film also indirectly contains anti-Semitism through the character of the cunning fox.",
      "The Army of Crime\nThe Army of Crime (French: L'Armée du crime ) is a 2009 French drama-war film directed by Robert Guédiguian and based on a story by Serge Le Péron, one of three credited for the screenplay.

Liberation by the army of crime\".",

H. Lawrence, Margot Asquith and many others. In 1925 he was hired by William Berry as editor-in-chief of the \"Sunday Chronicle\" to become the second youngest (after John Delane) British editor-in-chief of a newspaper ever, and remained in that position until 1946, whereupon he undertook a variety of other occupations. Among other things Drawbell wrote three autobiographies, which, in addition to being valuable and often minute accounts of the changing age, also contain unique and insightful recollections of his encounters with famous people from all walks of life—ranging from great men of letters such as Fitzgerald to politicians such as Hitler.",

      "Shine a Light (Calibre album)\nVery soon after the release of Shelf Life Vol. 2, Calibre stated he would be releasing his long anticipated down-tempo album. \"Shine a Light\", the sixth album by Belfast singer-songwriter & producer Calibre, was released on November 16, 2009 through his own imprint Signature Records. This was his first downtempo album. For many years Calibre suggested that he wanted to produce one but he seemed to avoid the situation. \"“I have spent over 10 years writing music, the majority of my work being drum and bass, so i wanted to write an album that wasn’t attached to a particular musical genre, to me it felt like feeling my way in the dark”.\"",
      "Jay Orpin\nJay Orpin (born April 29, 1976 in Stockholm, Sweden ) is a Swedish and Finnish songwriter and producer. He also writes songs and produced for Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Robyn, Ace of Base, Bon Jovi, 2gether and Britney Spears, and later he produced songs for Good Charlotte, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Hawthorne Heights, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, My Chemical Romance, Tokio Hotel, Lindsay Lohan, Dashboard Confessional, All American Rejects, Fall Out Boy, AFI, Evanescence, Hollywood Undead, t.A.T.u., Yellowcard, Hannah Montana, Linkin Park, Bullet for My Valentine and Taking Back Sunday. Most of his music is under the influence of today's modern pop punk, dance-punk, and emo music, but he does write some pop and hip-hop music as well. He also teamed up with Travis Barker in 2007, remixing popular hip-hop singles such as Throw Some D's, Party Like a Rockstar, and Crank That Soulja Boy. Even though he has written some of the works of some of the aforementioned artists, he is not one of the main producers of many of these artists and he chooses not to put his credit for his work. An original song written by such composer to be cited is yet to be found, however some has claimed an abbreviation of his name in one of the albums. In late 2008, he has decided to move in a small town near Oulu, Finland to raise his family and is a high school teacher and does accounting for bill paying in the summer to support the family, along with music production projects part-time, but he still continues to produce music today, but not as much as he used to. He did come back to help write a few new songs, such as In My Head by Jason Derulo. He has quit his part-time job in accounting to allow more time back in the music production business, to make a revival.",

They are known for mixing a 1960s feel with modern indie rock sensibilities. They have also been compared to Blondie. In 2000, the band released their first album, the instrumental \"Lights At Night\", which included a post-rock sound that would become much less evident in the group's future efforts. 2003 saw the release of \"Rock The Faces\", which Allmusic said \"is junk-shop pop at its finest. Built out of parts of various great bands and artists, it shines like a brand new artifact\" ([ link]).",

      "There's a Last Time for Everything\nThere's a Last Time for Everything is the second full-length studio album by singer-songwriter Lucy Wainwright Roche. The album was recorded over ten days in Nashville in collaboration with producer Jordan Brooke Hamlin. Of the quick recording, Lucy said, \"Jordan and I crafted these tracks over long summer days that stretched into late, late nights. We were gloriously swept up in the process, like kids working on a secret project. Because we were working with a limited time frame, we went with our gut on every decision. There wasn't time for us to second guess or retrace our steps. The urgency of working that way was exciting and freeing - and also a little bit terrifying.” The album was released on October 15, 2013.",

Some underlying questions are still under discussion regarding PKI involvement in the 30th September Movement and consequent Indonesian Massacre of 1965: what was the role of the Special Bureau, who was the main perpetrator, and what motivation did the PKI have to overthrow a leader that supported them? These questions do not have definitive answers, and are explored most extensively in John Roosa’s \"Pretext for Mass Murder.\"",

Kelly was born in New York City January 22, 1842. Both of his parents were musicians, and he began performing at 13 years old, at Wyatt's Theater in Hartford Connecticut. He continued in minstrel shows such as Bryant's and Christy's, as well as traveling panorama demonstrations, before moving to Cincinnati to record for the Ohio Phonograph Company (a regional subsidiary of the North American Phonograph Company). Kelly recorded also for the Columbia Phonograph Company and New Jersey Phonograph Company (also subsidiaries of North American at the time). An article in The Phonogram magazine speaks to his popularity in the early 1890s - \"Where is there a phonograph in the United States or Canada without a Brady? The answer is, no-where!\", and \"Kelly [...] stands to-day the acknowledged head of all humorous talkers for the phonograph\". For all of his fame in the earliest days of the phonograph industry, he doesn't seem to have made any recordings later than 1893 or 1894, and it's unclear what he did later in life.

      "Caravaggisti\nThe Caravaggisti (or the \"Caravagesques\") were stylistic followers of the 16th-century Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio. His influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from Mannerism was profound. Caravaggio never established a workshop as most other painters did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism which can only be deduced from his surviving work. But it can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Rubens, Jusepe de Ribera, Bernini, and Rembrandt. Famous while he lived, Caravaggio himself was forgotten almost immediately after his death. Many of his paintings were reascribed to his followers, such as \"The Taking of Christ\", which was attributed to the Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst until 1990. It was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. In the 1920s Roberto Longhi once more placed him in the European tradition: \"Ribera, Vermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of Delacroix, Courbet and Manet would have been utterly different\".

He is noted for his extended collaboration with director Francis Ford Coppola, having edited most of Coppola's films from 1969-1997. In particular, Malkin worked with Coppola on four of the component and compilation films of the \"Godfather Trilogy\", although he was not involved in the original 1972 film. Roger Ebert has written of \"The Godfather Part II\", which Malkin edited, \"... why is it a \"great movie\"? Because it must be seen as a piece with the unqualified greatness of \"The Godfather.\" The two can hardly be considered apart (\"Part III\" is another matter). When the characters in a film take on a virtual reality for us, when a character in another film made 30 years later can say \"The Godfather\" contains all the lessons in life you need to know, when an audience understands why that statement could be made, a film has become a cultural bedrock.\"",

With the help of his talent in oratory in political debates and public speeches, Kossuth emerged from a poor gentry family into regent-president of Kingdom of Hungary. As the most influential contemporary American journalist Horace Greeley said of Kossuth: “Among the orators, patriots, statesmen, exiles, he has, living or dead, no superior.” Kossuth's powerful English and American speeches so impressed and touched the most famous contemporary American orator Daniel Webster, that he wrote a book about Kossuth's life. He was widely honored during his lifetime, including in Great Britain and the United States, as a freedom fighter and bellwether of democracy in Europe. Kossuth's bronze bust can be found in the United States Capitol with the inscription: \"Father of Hungarian Democracy, Hungarian Statesman, Freedom Fighter, 1848–1849\".",

Ruhtenberg was involved in the Bauhaus movement in Germany, studying under Mies van der Rohe and worked with Philip Johnson. In \"The International Style: Architecture Since 1922\" Johnson acknowledges Ruhtenberg as one of two “kind friends” who have read and criticized draft texts. Johnson and fellow author Henry-Russell Hitchcock included Ruhtenberg’s 1930 Berlin apartment house interior among their illustrations of modern design. In his biography of Philip Johnson, architectural historian Franz Schulze refers to Ruhtenberg as Johnson's new friend during the latter's travels in Germany in 1929. The two visited the Bauhaus in Dessau together. At the time Ruhtenberg was a public relations aide to designer Bruno Paul. Johnson, working with Henry-Russell Hitchcock, was gathering material for \"The International Style: Architecture Since 1922.\" Ruhtenberg was traveling with them. Schulze cites Johnson's letter of 17 September 1930 to J. J. P. Oud, a Dutch modernist architect, in which Johnson called Ruhtenberg his best friend, describing him as a beginning architecture student. Three years later in another letter to Oud, Johnson tells him that he is building a house in Manhattan with his friend Jan Ruhtenberg. He was active in many areas of country such as New York City with both his architectural skills (the renovation of 57 East 93rd Street that was reviewed by \"Architectural Forum\" in 1937); He is \"credited\" with the interior design of Nelson Rockefeller's Penthouse at 810 Fifth Avenue (62nd Street) by the New York Times;  and his opinions on the progressive housing movement which were recorded for the Library of Congress.",

      "Dearborn-Putnam controversy\nThe Dearborn-Putnam controversy erupted in 1818 when Henry Dearborn published a post-war account of General Israel Putnam's performance during the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775. Both Putnam and the much younger Dearborn were present before and during the battle, with Dearborn at the front lines while Putnam was about the battle scene directing troops and overseeing the construction of fortifications before the fighting began. Accounts of Putnam's presence during the battle, however, have varied among veteran officers of the battle and some historians. During the battle, there was a fair amount of disorganization among the hastily assembled Continental Army and militia, making it difficult for any one participant to give an overall assessment of everyone's performance. The actual controversy was sparked 43 years after the battle, when Dearborn published his account of the battle in a widely read political magazine accusing the deceased Putnam of failing to supply reinforcements, inaction, and cowardice. The sons of both Dearborn and Putnam defended their respective fathers' positions, while various Revolutionary War veterans also lent their support respectively. Along with Dearborn, both Republicans and Federalists, now bitter rivals, saw the controversy as an opportunity to advance their party and win the favor of the general public. Dearborn's efforts, however, were largely not well received and cost him his bid for the governorship of Massachusetts. His accusations resulted in a political and social controversy that was widely covered in the press and in several publications from officers present at the battle. Dearborn's accusations were also addressed by several notable public figures, including Daniel Webster. As such, the controversy remained prominent in the public eye for more than 30 years.",

      "The Diary of a Public Man\nThe Diary of a Public Man was first published anonymously in the \"North American Review\" in 1879. Its entries are dated between December 28, 1860, and March 15, 1861, the desperate weeks just before the start of the American Civil War. The Diary appeared to offer verbatim accounts, penned by a long-time Washington insider, of behind-the-scenes discussions at the very highest levels during the greatest crisis the country had yet faced. Its pithy quotations attributed to the key principals -— Stephen A. Douglas, William H. Seward, and especially Abraham Lincoln —- have long been accepted by historians. David Potter, a leading specialist on 1860-61, said it contained \"astonishing\" revelations made by someone \"who possessed an authoritative personal knowledge of affairs at the time of secession.” In the 21st century historians concluded that the diary was written by journalist William Henry Hurlbert in 1879, and represents not a real diary but a memoir. It contains both valuable unique information as well as a few fictional elements.",

Both women were heavily pregnant and went into labour almost simultaneously, with the result that Alexander arrived just before midnight on April 21, 1846 and his first cousin early the following day. Family legend had it that, after the two babes had been placed on red plush cushions to be admired by one and all, their mothers reclaimed the wrong babes! If that was the case, then Alexander was the man who, as Robert Whitla, emigrated to North America to distinguish himself in the Canadian Rifles. Another first cousin was Sir William Whitla, physician and politician, after whom the Whitla Hall at Queen’s University Belfast is named.",

      "Amelia Douglas\nAmelia Douglas (1 January 1812-8 January 1890) was a Canadian Métis of mixed Irish, French and Cree heritage who was the spouse of the first colonial governor of British Columbia, when the Colony of British Columbia was established. Raised as the daughter of a trapper and his First Nations wife, she spent her early childhood moving frequently between fur trading stations in Manitoba. When her father was promoted to agent of Fort St. James in what would later become British Columbia, she met a mixed-race trapper of Scottish and Bajan Creole heritage, who would become her husband. As her husband progressed from clerk to Chief Factor and governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island and later the Colony of British Columbia, she served as a nurse and midwife at his various posts. She gave birth to thirteen children, raising six to adulthood. Her children were brought up in the Victorian European style, though she insured that they were schooled in the cultural heritage of their Cree ancestors.",
      "Prefontaine\nPréfontaine is a family surname of French-Canadian origin. All Préfontaines in North America are descended from Antoine Fournier \"dit Préfontaine\" (born in 1663 in Picardie, France; died in 1702 in Montréal, Canada). He was a French soldier and a barrel cooper by trade in the Compagnie de Troyes, Troupes de la Marine. At the time it was common for French soldiers to adopt a nom de guerre often in reference to a trade, a place or a military rank. Antoine's nom de guerre was \"dit Préfontaine\", French for \"field (\"pré\") with a spring (\"fontaine\")\". He arrived in New France in August 1685 and took part in Chevalier Pierre de Troyes successful raid on several English trading posts in the Hudson Bay and James Bay regions from March to October 1686 (Hudson Bay expedition (1686)). He married Marie Ronceray in 1688 in Longueuil, Québec. Antoine's only son, Adrien (1693–1760), was an important businessman and a major figure in the economic development of New France. Adrien in turn had a son by the same name, who was a slave owner and was killed at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759. By the early-to-mid-19th century, the various families descended from Antoine dropped the Fournier part of the surname in favour of Préfontaine. Two brothers from Longueuil, Québec, Alexis and Toussaint Fournier dit Préfontaine, participated in the initial engagement of the Lower Canada Rebellion, the Chambly Road incident of November 17, 1837. The rebels were inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, republicanism and the desire for responsible and representative government. Alexis, an officer in the militia, resigned his commission the day before joining the Rebellion. When the Rebellion collapsed in November 1838, and after proudly admitting their active participation, even under the possible penalty of death or exile, both brothers were to spend a year in jail along with 1,100 other Patriotes. Two of Toussaint's sons, Raymond and François-Xavier, went on to have notable careers in their respective professions (see below). During the second half of the 19th century, several Préfontaine families emigrated from Québec to New England, the Midwest and the North-West of the United States. Others emigrated to Western Canada, notably to Manitoba and Saskatchewan.",

      "Swedish name\nIn Sweden, a person must have a surname and one or more given names. Two given names are common. Surnames are inherited from the parents, in the order of \"same as elder sibling, if any; specified by parents; or mother's last name,\" while given names must be chosen by the parents at birth. The calling name (Swedish \"tilltalsnamn\", French \"Prénom usuel\") by which the person is normally identified in conversation, is in Scandinavian countries (and previously in France) one of the given names, not necessarily the first. In contexts where the full name is spelled out, the calling name is often indicated by an asterisk, by capital letters, or underlines or italics. For example, Märta Birgit* Nilsson is known as Birgit Nilsson, while Agnetha* Åse Fältskog is known as Agnetha Fältskog.",

      "Name of Joan of Arc\nJoan of Arc did not come from a place called \"Arc\", but was born and raised in the village of Domrémy in what was then the northeastern frontier of the Kingdom of France. In the English language her first name has been repeated as \"Joan\" since the fifteenth century because that was the only English equivalent for the feminine form of \"John\" during her lifetime. Her surviving signatures are all spelled \"Jehanne\" without surname. In French her name is today always rendered as \"Jeanne d'Arc\", reflecting the modern spelling of her first name. The surname \"of Arc\" is a translation of \"d'Arc,\" which itself is a nineteenth-century French approximation of her father's name. Apostrophes were never used in fifteenth-century French surnames, which sometimes leads to confusion between place names and other names that begin with the letter \"D\". Based on Latin records, which do reflect a difference, her father's name was more likely \"Darc\". Spelling was also phonetic and original records produce his surname in at least nine different forms, such as \"Dars\", \"Day\", \"Darx, Dare, Tarc, Tart\" or \"Dart\".",

Schooling was previously divided four ways - English or French, Catholic or Protestant. All high schools within a large catch area were closed and students bussed to high school daily. High schools in communities like Magog, Sherbrooke, Lennoxville, Stanstead, Scotstown, Sawyerville, Coaticook and Cookshire were converted to elementary schools, where younger children from the Baby boom were already swelling the capacity. The loss of identity based on their local high school was a challenge which many small communities did not survive.",

The spiel in each PSA talks about learning more about what happened in the program, the books the Library of Congress suggests, and that they can be found in their local library or bookstore.

One of these films was \"Der schoenste Tag in meinem Leben\" (1957) in which he played a chorister in the Vienna Boys' Choir. There is an image of him, for example, on the HBC choir-film pages.

Middle-market status is the halfway point of a three-level continuum of journalistic seriousness; uppermarket or \"quality\" newspapers generally cover hard news and down-market newspapers favour sensationalist stories. In the United Kingdom, since the demise of \"Today\" (1986–1995), the only national middle-market papers are the \"Daily Mail\" and the \"Daily Express\", distinguishable by their black-top masthead (both use the easy-to-carry tabloid paper size), as opposed to the red-top mastheads of down-market tabloids.",

      "History of newspaper publishing\nThe modern newspaper is a European invention. The oldest direct ancestors of the modern newspaper were the handwritten news sheets that circulated widely in Venice as early as 1566. These weekly news sheets were filled with information on wars and politics in Italy and Europe. The first printed newspapers were published weekly in Germany from 1609. Typically they were heavily censored by the government and reported only foreign news, and current prices. After the English government relaxed censorship in 1695, newspapers flourished in London and a few other cities including Boston and Philadelphia. By the 1830s high speed presses could print thousands of papers cheaply, so low cost daily papers appeared in major cities. Most had political sponsors, but by 1900 advertising revenues became more important than party support. In New York City newspaper wars pushed circulation to the level of a million copies a day. In England and Scotland the tendency was for national newspapers to dominate sales. The rise of radio in the 1930s had a small impact but television from the 1950s onward undercut the audience. Afternoon papers could barely survive. The rise of the internet after 2000 and smart phones after 2010 proved financially crippling to morning papers as advertisers deserted, and subscriptions plunged.",

The articles are presented in the format of a British Sunday newspaper, with the copy distributed in columns across the body of the paper, and commonly feature lists of items or instructions. Sketches are broken up, and often use backing music which also stops and starts along with the reading of the column. This leads to a surreal, Dadaist juxtaposition of sketches, with jokes being set up at the beginning of the episode and the punchline being delivered at a random point before the end.",

By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms “Siren Servers,” alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. For example, he points to Google's translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. As a solution to this problem, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson’s Project Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.",

Although many of the tablets are associated with locations visited by Boone, many were simply placed wherever Mr. Rich could collect the necessary donations from schools, communities, etc. to erect a monument. He established the Boone Trail Highway Association to further his project. From the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s, the Association published a newsletter which detailed the efforts to install new monuments.",
      "Land Arts of the American West\nLand Arts of the American West is a studio-based field program that seeks to construct an expanded definition of land art through direct experience connecting the full range of human interventions in the landscape—from pre-contact indigenous to contemporary practice. Land art includes everything from constructing a road, to taking a walk, building a monument, and leaving a mark in the sand. The program seeks to expand upon connections between typically separate fields. Each fall we spend two months camping while traveling 7,000 miles to engage sites that range from the CLUI complex at Wendover, Utah to the pottery culture at Mata Ortiz, Mexico, from earth works like Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty to archeological sites like Chaco Canyon. We learn from the fact that Donald Judd surrounded himself with both contemporary sculpture and Navajo rugs; that Chaco Canyon and Roden Crater function as celestial instruments; and that the Very Large Array is a scientific research center with a powerful aesthetic presence on the land. We spend the semester living and working in the landscape with guest scholars that expand the range of our definition in disciplines including archeology, art history, architecture, ceramics, criticism, writing, design, and studio art. The immersive nature of how we experience the landscape triggers an amalgamated body of inquiry where students have the opportunity of time and space to develop authority in their work through direct action and reflection. Land Arts hinges on the primacy of first person experience and the realization that human-land relationships are rarely singular.",

      "Battle Monument (West Point)\nBattle Monument is a large Tuscan column monument located on Trophy Point at the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY. Designed by Stanford White, it was dedicated on 30 May 1897 by surviving Civil War veterans. The monument was financed by monthly contributions from the pay of the officers and soldiers of the regular army. The granite column, standing 46 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter, is reputed to be the largest column of polished granite in the Western Hemisphere. Inscribed on bronze straps belting the eight monumental \"cannon balls\" circling the column are the names of 2,230 Regular Army officers and soldiers who died for the Union during the Civil War. Designed by Frederick MacMonnies, a female statue sits atop the monument, representing \"fame\". The statue that now tops the monument is actually the second version of the statue. Just months after it was unveiled, MacMonnies agreed to replace the original statue after complaints that it was too large and awkward. Traditionally, the plebes at West Point made reference to the statue of Fame when giving the following reply to any upperclassman demanding to know \"How are they all?\": \"They are all fickle but one, sir.\" \"Who is the one?\" \"She who stands atop Battle Monument, for she has been on the same shaft since 1897;\" however, this is no longer current practice.",

For example, in one of her series, \"As the Stars Go By\", Von Merten's hand-stitched a pattern of star rotation serves as a way to document violent moments in American history. She has stated of the series, \"The work is intended to act on many levels: as a memorial, as an actual vantage from a specific moment in history, but ultimately I am simply documenting an impassive natural cycle that is oblivious to the violence below.\"",
      "Totem pole\nTotem poles are monumental carvings, a type of Northwest Coast art, consisting of poles, posts or pillars, carved with symbols or figures. They are usually made from large trees, mostly western red cedar, by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America (Washington, Oregon, and Canada's western province, British Columbia). The word \"totem\" derives from the Algonquian (most likely Ojibwe) word \"odoodem\" [oˈtuːtɛm ], \"(his) kinship group\". The carvings may symbolize or commemorate cultural beliefs that recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events. The poles may also serve as functional architectural features, welcome signs for village visitors, mortuary vessels for the remains of deceased ancestors, or as a means to publicly ridicule someone. They may embody a historical narrative of significance to the people carving and installing the pole. Given the complexity and symbolic meanings of totem pole carvings, their placement and importance lies in the observer's knowledge and connection to the meanings of the figures and the culture in which they are embedded.",

Backed up by a pair of transvestite guardian angels (played by The Big Wigs), Wynona-Sue faces a variety of indignities including an abusive husband, the threat of life imprisonment and venereal disease. The film’s humor ranged from gross-out to surreal (the heroine’s gynecologist was an Elvis Presley imitator), and the entire film was shot on Day-Glo sets designed and built by Wild.",
      "Kula ring\nKula, also known as the Kula exchange or Kularing, is a ceremonial exchange system conducted in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea. The Kula ring was made famous by the father of modern anthropology, Bronisław Malinowski, who used this test case to argue for the universality of rational decision making (even among 'natives'), and for the cultural nature of the object of their effort. Malinowski's path-breaking work, \"Argonauts of the Western Pacific\" (1922), directly confronted the question, \"why would men risk life and limb to travel across huge expanses of dangerous ocean to give away what appear to be worthless trinkets?\" Malinowski carefully traced the network of exchanges of bracelets and necklaces across the Trobriand Islands, and established that they were part of a system of exchange (the Kula ring), and that this exchange system was clearly linked to political authority. Malinowski's study became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of \"The Gift\" (\"Essai sur le don,\" 1925). Since then, the Kula ring has been central to the continuing anthropological debate on the nature of gift giving, and the existence of gift economies.",

The Sun Road, as it is sometimes abbreviated in National Park Service documents, is the only road that traverses the park crossing the Continental Divide through Logan Pass at an elevation of 6,646 feet (2,026 m), which is the highest point on the road. Construction began in 1921 and was completed in 1932 with formal dedication in the following summer on July 15, 1933. The road is the first to have been registered in all of the following categories: National Historic Place, National Historic Landmark and Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The length of the road is approximately 50 miles (80 km) and spans the width of the park between the east and west entrance stations. The National Historic Landmark Nomination records a slightly shorter distance of 48.7 miles which is measured from the first main intersection just outside the park's west entrance to Divide Creek in St. Mary on the east side of the park.",
      "The Neverwas Haul\nThe Neverwas Haul is a three-story, self-propelled mobile art vehicle built to resemble a Victorian house on wheels. Inspired by the fantastical stories of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, the Haul was designed by Shannon O’Hare and built by a crew of volunteers at the Shipyard art space in Berkeley, CA, in 2006. Originally intended to be a ‘mutant vehicle’ for the Burning Man art festival in Nevada, the Haul is made from 75% recycled materials, and measures 24 feet long, 24 feet high, and 12 feet wide. It is built on the base of a fifth-wheel trailer, and the second and third story of the structure pack down into the first for highway towing. When fully built and decked out for exhibition at Burning Man, the Haul is able to propel itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and requires a crew of ten people to operate safely (since Victorian houses are notoriously lacking in side- and rear-view mirrors). Currently, the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works, an “art car factory” in Vallejo, CA, owned by O’Hare and home to several other self-styled “contraptionists.”",
      "The Augustas\nThe Augustas (filmed in the early 1930s and the late 1940s) is a home movie made by Scott Nixon, an avid member of the Amateur Cinema League and a traveling salesman based in Augusta, Georgia who enjoyed recording his travels on film. In this 16-minute silent film, Nixon documents some 38 streets, storefronts and cities named Augusta in such far-flung locales as Montana and Maine. Arranged with no apparent rhyme or reason, the film strings together brief snapshots of these Augustas, many of which are indicated at the point of a pencil on a train timetable or road map. Nixon photographed his odyssey using both 8mm and 16mm movie cameras loaded with black-and-white and color motion picture film stock, amassing 26,000 feet of film that now resides at the University of South Carolina. While Nixon’s film does not illuminate the historical or present-day significance of these towns, it binds them together under the umbrella of Americana. Whether intentionally or coincidentally, this amateur auteur seems to juxtapose the name’s lofty origin—‘august,’ meaning great or venerable—with the unspectacular nature of everyday life in small-town America.",

      "Leather-Winged Bat\n\"Leather-Winged Bat\" is a well-known English folk song about a collection of \"birds\". The song's most used cast members are usually bat, a wood pecker, a blue bird, owl and turtle dove. However, depending on the artist, the song can have different creatures. Such as Peter, Paul and Mary's 1969 version which has a bat, a black bird, wood pecker, turtle dove, and a blue jay. Each \"bird\" has something to say about love and courtship in some sort of rhyming manner. It was recorded by Burl Ives on 31 January 1941 and released in August 1941 on the album \"Okeh Presents the Wayfaring Stranger\". It has also been recorded by Pete Seeger, The Duhks, Bill Staines, Spider John Koerner, Peter, Paul and Mary, Kitty White, Nettles, Vicki Neville, Kim Milai, Anne Price and Warren Fremling.",

It was written by Mitch Brian and directed by Kevin Altieri. That was the first episode of the series to feature the villain Man-Bat and was also Man-Bat's first screen appearance. In comics, Man-Bat first appeared in 1970. Although \"On Leather Wings\" was the first episode of the series to be produced, it was the second to be broadcast, following \"The Cat and the Claw, Part 1\", which premiered just the day before.",

Early the following year, the gory extended track \"D.O.A.\" became the biggest hit of Bloodrock's career when issued in shorter form as a single. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA January 3, 1990. Art direction: George Osaka. (The motivation for writing this song was explained in 2005 by guitarist Lee Pickens. “When I was 17, I wanted to be an airline pilot,” Pickens said. “I had just gotten out of this airplane with a friend of mine, at this little airport, and I watched him take off. He went about 200 feet in the air, rolled and crashed.” The band decided to write a song around the incident and include it on this, their second album).",

Other members include Fritz Richmond (engineering), Rick Rodrigues (cover art), Lorrie Sullivan (photography), and Robert Heimall (art direction). Not much is known about this band except the information you find on the back cover of their first and only album. If you don't listen to it, the only thing that stands out on this album is the fact that famous producer Paul A. Rothchild (who produced albums by The Doors, Janis Joplin, and Rush just to name a few) produced this album. Most of the core band went on to join AOR band L.A. Jets, then most of L.A. Jets went on to record under the name 1994. Both L.A. Jets and 1994 included GoodThunder members John Desautels, Bill Rhodes, Terry Linvill, and included singer/songwriter Karen Lawrence.

After a change of personnel in April 1967, the band changed their name to \"Art\", and released the album \"Supernatural Fairy Tales\". They also participated to a psychedelic bizarre album called \"Featuring The Human Host And The Heavy Metal Kids\" by a collective known as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, formed by Guy Stevens and an influential British graphic design and avant-garde musical partnership between Michael English and Nigel Waymouth. The musicians involved in that project were Mike Harrison on keys and vocals, Luther Grosvenor on guitars, Greg Ridley on bass and Mike Kellie on drums, as well as performances by Stevens, English and Waymouth. It was the first time that the term \"heavy metal\" was ever used in music, even though that album had nothing to do with heavy metal music, being closer to psychedelic music. That album was published in 1967 on Liberty Records and contained only five songs from two minutes to more than 15 minutes of psychedelic and almost meditative state kind of music.",

Though he left Iron Butterfly after only one album due to internal tensions, his work was an influence in the band for most of their history, since his replacement Erik Brann made a conscious effort to imitate his playing. Weis later recounted \"Erik Braunn replaced me in Iron Butterfly, and if I remember correctly, he bought a lot of my equipment, some of my clothes, they tried to clone me basically...\"",

The band consisted of the Shaw brothers, Loren \"Wally\" Walsted on lead guitar (who died from a heart attack on Sept. 3. 2014), and John Collins on rhythm guitar. This form of the group stayed together from 1963 to 1967 and recorded one single; a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Maggie's Farm\" backed with a cover of \"Bye Bye Johnny.\" The Defiants broke up in 1967 when John Collins was drafted for service in the Vietnam War but opted to join the Marines instead. Mike Shaw and Terry R. Shaw later formed the group Shaw-Allen-Shaw with Jim Allen. That group recorded two albums, set many ballroom attendance records and, in 2006, was inducted into the Mid-America Music Hall of Fame (formerly the Minnesota Rock/Country Hall of Fame). Terry R.

In this case, the album was released under another group name, Markley A Group, as decided by the group owner, Bob Markley. It features compositions by Danny Harris, Michael Lloyd and Shaun Harris with lyrics by Bob Markley. The content is simple and soft, reminiscent of the band's earlier work. Lyrically, however, the band was continuing the trend set by \"Where's My Daddy?\", in which they describe class resentment, paranoid psychedelia, and an unsettling interest in young girls. Although Shaun Harris creates compositions for the album, he only appears on \"Outside/Inside\". After this album, like those before it, failed to achieve success, the band ceased to exist.",
      "Trevor Watts\nTrevor Charles Watts (born 26 February 1939 in York) is an English jazz and free-improvising alto and soprano saxophonist.

While stationed in Germany with the RAF (1958–63), he encountered the drummer John Stevens and trombonist Paul Rutherford. After being demobbed he returned to London. In 1965 he and Stevens formed the Spontaneous Music Ensemble, which became one of the crucibles of British free improvisation. Watts left the band to form his own group Amalgam in 1967, then returned to SME for another stretch that lasted until the mid-1970s. Another key association was with the bassist Barry Guy and his London Jazz Composers' Orchestra, an association that lasted from the band's inception in the 1970s up to its (permanent?) disbandment in the mid-1990s.",

Recorded live at the Roxy in Hollywood, they perform parodies of 50's rock ballads (\"Night After Night,\" \"Creature Without a Head\"). In between, there's plenty of schtick and patter (\"So's Your Old Testament,\" \"Babyland\"). The album is now a collector’s item because of credited guitar work by future Spinal Tap member Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest). A photo on the inside cover also includes two band members, \"Murph\", the keyboard player from The Blues Brothers, and \"Ming the Merciless,\" purported to be Kiss drummer Peter Criss without his famous \"cat\" costume and make-up, though Criss denies it was him. McKean has confirmed that the drummer in the photograph is actually Don Poncher.",

Much of the band's music consisted of electric organ-driven instrumentals and an enigmatic image inspired by the science fiction film \"The Mysterians\". In addition, the band's sound was also marked by raw-resonating lead vocals of \"?\" (Question Mark, the stage name of Rudy Martinez), making Question Mark and the Mysterians one of the earliest groups whose musical style is described as punk rock.

It was released on October 10, 2000. Its track listing differs from that of the LP version, which is part of the \"Back From the Grave\" LP-edition series, also on Crypt. In keeping with all of the entries in the series, and as indicated in the subheading which reads \"Raw 'n' Crude Mid-60s Garage Punk!,\" this collection consists of many songs which display the rawer and more aggressive side of the genre and are often characterized by the use of fuzztone-distorted guitars and rough vocals. Accordingly, the set generally excludes psychedelic, folk rock, and pop-influenced material in favor of basic primitive rock and roll. The packaging features a booklet containing well-researched liner notes written by Tim Warren which conveys basic information about each song and group, such as origin, recording date, and biographical sketches, usually written in a conversational style that includes occasional slang, anecdotes, humorous asides. The liner notes are noticeably opinionated, sometimes engaging in tongue-in-cheek insults directed at other genres of music. The booklet also includes photographs of the bands, and the front cover features a highly satirical cartoon by Mort Todd depicting revivified \"rock and roll\" zombies who, on this occasion, with the help of Batman's sidekick, Robin, have taken the 1966 TV series Batmobile out for a \"wild joyride\" and are intent on causing as much mayhem as possible and \"lassoing\" unsuspecting bystanders—only on this outing, their \"victims\" are more \"randomly selected\" than as customarily portrayed on \"Back from the Grave\" sleeves.",
      "Simon Says (album)\nSimon Says is the first album by the American bubblegum pop group the 1910 Fruitgum Company on the Buddah Records label. Released in 1968, it included two songs that appeared on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100—the most from any of the group's albums—although it was not their highest-charting album. It's been debated whether or not the members of the band actually played on the album since the Ohio Express, another band put together by Super K Productions (headed by Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz), actually consisted of two groups: one that produced the records and another that toured and promoted the name. This is countered by original drummer Floyd Marcus, who has stated that all five men listed really were behind the instruments.",
      "Meet The Smithereens!\nMeet The Smithereens! is the seventh studio album by Carteret, New Jersey-based rock band The Smithereens. The album features the band covering The Beatles' 1964 debut American album, \"Meet The Beatles!\". Based on the fact that he is not on the cover and that he is not credited in the insert booklet, this is The Smithereens' first album without original bassist Mike Mesaros (replaced by Severo \"The Thrilla\" Jornacion). According to Pat DiNizio, the band immersed themselves in 1964 ephemera (like the bobbleheads that made the cover) in preparation for recording. The album was released in stores on January 16, 2007.",
      "These Things Too\nBy early 1969, the original line-up of Pearls Before Swine - which had only ever performed in the studio, never live - was disintegrating around its leader and mainstay, singer and songwriter Tom Rapp. Original members Lane Lederer and Roger Crissinger had left, and Rapp had married Dutch traveller Elisabeth (surname unrecorded), whom he had met in New York when recording the album \"Balaklava\". Original member Wayne Harley remained in the group, but left shortly after \"These Things Too\" was recorded.",
      "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\n\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\" is a popular song written in 1947 by Frank Loesser as an independent song—not written for a particular movie or musical. It first charted for The Orioles, peaking at No. 9 on \"Billboard\"'s Best-Selling Retail Rhythm & Blues chart in December 1949. Other charted versions include Danté & The Evergreens (No. 107 on \"Billboard\"'s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles in December 1960) and Nancy Wilson (No. 17 on \"Billboard\"'s Christmas Singles chart in December 1965 and No. 24 on the same chart in December 1967).",
      "Metamorphosis (Iron Butterfly album)\nMetamorphosis is the fourth studio album by Iron Butterfly, released on August 13, 1970. Though not as successful as its predecessor \"Ball\" (1969), it reached number 16 on the US charts. Erik Brann, who left because of band disputes, was replaced by four session guitarists. Two of them, Mike Pinera, and Larry \"Rhino\" Reinhardt (called El Rhino on the sleeve), would become members of Iron Butterfly shortly after the album's release. Officially, the album is credited not to Iron Butterfly, but to \"Iron Butterfly with Pinera & Rhino\", in reference to the two aforementioned guitarists.",

In 2002 the album was released again with the original cover in North America with the addition of two live tracks \"Still I Wonder\" and \"Young Legs\" the tracks were originally to be included on the live album Raw also released in 2002. Also unique to the 2002 North America release, is the inclusion of an edited version of \"Yucatan Man\" The 2002 Bullseye Records version of the album features a nice testimonial from Canadian “Metal Queen” Lee Aaron about drummer Bill Wade, who played on LEE's debut album called \"The Lee Aaron Project\". \"I first worked with Billy when I was about 19. I was young and very green in the industry — Bill was about 33 at that time — and I remember having a bad couple of weeks. My expectations of the industry were pretty grandiose at that stage: I was a kid with stars in my eyes. Bill took me aside one night and, like a kind, loving father, said I had to remember to be grateful and that I had to remember every day that I was lucky to be in this business and working. Throughout the course of my career, especially at times when I felt like hanging up my microphone, I always remember those words he imparted to me. It's sad to think that such a cool and talented person can be taken at such a young age.\"",
      "Orkustra\nOrkustra was a band that tried a synthesis between symphonic orchestra and psychedelic band. The result was a sort of freeform psychedelia. According to member Bobby Beausoleil, the group was originally known as \"The Electric Chamber Orchestra.\" The name was changed to avoiding limiting bookings to small venues . The band existed a little more than a year before splitting in the summer of 1967. Beausoleil went on to work with Kenneth Anger and played the main role in the film \"Lucifer Rising\" before becoming involved with Charles Manson and his gang. Another player was David LaFlamme who later founded It's a Beautiful Day. Beausoleil has called the group \"a launch pad to all of its members\"  During their heyday the band released no recordings, but RD Records of Switzerland has now released an LP with Orkustra music in collaboration with Beausoleil.",
      "It Ain't Over...\nIt Ain't Over is an album by the British band The Outfield, released to their fan club. It was their first album of all new material for six years, since 1992's \"Rockeye\", and was also their debut album on the 'Warning Tracks' label. (With the exception of the title track \"It Ain't Over,\" all of the songs also appear on the subsequent release \"Extra Innings\".) Dave Harris, who managed the band in 1998, and host of Retro rewind revealed this on his show in 2004: \"A lot of the songs on \"It Ain't Over\" were from the archives. These were songs that John and Tony had recorded years earlier and I convinced them to gather them so that we can go through them and put it out for eager fans. John and I chose the songs for release, a process that took a few months. We mastered them in Nashville in August 1998 and decided to release it on our own label. We printed up about 2000 copies and sold them at the shows on the 'It Ain't Over tour' in 1998. So needless to say this incarnation of the CD is a collectors item.\"",

Howard Morris directed an ensemble cast that included Jim Hutton, Dorothy Provine, Walter Brennan and Milton Berle.

      "The Firesign Theatre's Big Book of Plays\nThe Firesign Theatre's Big Book Of Plays is a collection of transcriptions written by The Firesign Theatre for the title tracks of each of their first four albums. The book also contains some introductory material that is serious as well a few pieces that parody introductory material. Photos of the group—childhood photos, casual snapshots, and full-costume publicity shots vaguely related to the written material—are included. The book concludes with \"Lt. Bradshaw's Secret Indentity [sic] Roster\" which indicates which member of the group performs each major role. Some of the material from the group's first four albums that was not included in this collection can be found in the 1974 book, \"The Firesign Theatre's Big Mystery Joke Book\".

      "Album III\nAlbum III, as its title indicates, is the third full album from Loudon Wainwright III. It was originally released in 1972 on Columbia Records. \"Album III\" would spawn Loudon Wainwright's most popular hit single, \"Dead Skunk\", one of the many 'novelty songs' sprinkled throughout Wainwright's career. Although Wainwright has maintained an ironic, sometimes sepulchral sense of humor, \"Dead Skunk\", despite its commercial success, has dogged him ever since, as he comments on 1985's album \"I'm Alright\", \"Were you embarrassed about 'Dead Skunk'\"?",

They enjoyed local success, but relocated in hopes of reaching a wider audience. They played for a short time in Tucson, Arizona, but then moved their base of operations for to Denver, Colorado, and were briefly signed there to A&M Records, recording an unreleased album for the label. They eventually traveled to Washington, DC and New York City to secure another recording arrangement that never materialized.

      "Flaming Youth (band)\nIn 1969, American singer John Walker, of the Waker Brothers fame, toured in England, and was accompanied by four young British musicians: on keyboards Brian Chatton, on guitar and bass guitar Gordon \"Flash\" Smith, on bass and guitar Ronnie Caryl and on drums, Phil Collins. After the tour, they decided to go on together, found a name for their band, Hickory, and recorded a single in 1969, \"Green Light/The Key\". And then they met two authors-songwriters, Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, who were looking for a band to record an album they were working on, so they changed their name and became Flaming Youth. The group released the album \"Ark 2\" in 1969. In November of that same year, the British music magazine \"NME\" reported that the concept album was the subject of an hour-long television special, which the group had filmed in the Netherlands. The LP was released on Fontana Records in the UK to some critical but no commercial success. There was also a follow-up single recorded, \"Man, Woman, and Child\".

      "The Neon Philharmonic\nThe Neon Philharmonic (formed 1967) was an American psychedelic pop band led by songwriter and conductor Tupper Saussy and singer Don Gant.

The group disbanded in 1975 after releasing numerous non-album singles.

      "From Keflavík, With Love\nFrom Keflavík, With Love is a retrospective anthology issued in 2001 by Big Beat Records consisting of twenty songs by Thor's Hammer (Hljómar), a 1960s garage rock and beat group from Iceland who were one of the best-known Icelandic groups during the era. Though they worked with different producers on various labels, Thor's Hammer sound is best-typified by the tough, aggressive fuzz-drenched rockers they recorded in London for Parlophone Records in 1966, such as \"I Don't Care,\" \"My Life,\" \"Better Days,\" and \"The Big Beat Country Dance\", and \"If You Knew\". While the lyrics to most of their songs were sung in English, several tracks were recorded in their native Icelandic, such as \"Fyrsti Kossinn\", \"Ef Hún Er Nálægt Mér\", and \"Ertu Med\", which was covered by the Savages on their \"Live 'n Wild\" album. Some of the tracks from Thor's Hammer's final period in the late 1960s, such as \"Stay\", show the group stretching their sound stylistically, augmenting certain arrangements with keyboards and horns. At his time, Thor's Hammer moved into a more eclectic direction, but they broke up in 1969, with several of their members going on to join the progressive rock group, Trubrot.",
      "Detroit (band)\nDetroit (a.k.a. The Band Detroit, so as not to be confused with the city of Detroit) was a spinoff of rock group The Detroit Wheels. This revised version of that band was formed by Mitch Ryder as a successor to The Wheels in 1970. The only original Wheel in the group was the drummer Johnny \"Bee\" Badanjek; other members were guitarists Steve Hunter and Brett Tuggle, organist Harry Phillips and bassist W.R. Cooke. A single album was released by this grouping, a 1971 self-titled LP issued on Paramount Records (US #176 in 1972). They had a hit with their version of the Lou Reed - penned song \"Rock & Roll\", which Reed liked enough to ask Steve Hunter to join his backing band. Ryder quit the group because of voice problems in 1972, and Detroit vocalist Rusty Day (formerly of the American Amboy Dukes and Cactus) took over his spot; without Ryder, the group floundered, and eventually broke up in 1974.",
      "Black Mark Production\nBlack Mark Production (founded 1991) is an independent record label originally based in Berlin, later on with offices in Stockholm, Toronto and New York City etc. Black Mark Productions today is a worldwide operating business placed in Villa Hammerheart, Bruzaholm, Sweden, that specializes in extreme metal releases, perhaps best known for its close connection to Quorthon, leader of the defining black metal band Bathory until his death in 2004. As Quorthon himself has stated several times, it was often speculated that he had something to do with the business and operation of Black Mark Productions, except for the concept and name of the label, which would be referenced in the title of the 1987 release \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\". Quorthon received permission from the Tyfon Grammofon label - which was owned by Börje \"Boss\" Forsberg and of course featured Bathory - to use his own proxy-label on all Bathory albums, along with a unique 666-X serial number, starting with the self-titled debut album from 1984, but the label wasn't founded as a separate entity before 1991.

      "The Gospel According to the Meninblack\nThe Gospel According to The Meninblack (or sometimes referred to as just \"The Meninblack\") is the fifth album by The Stranglers, an esoteric concept album released in 1981. The album deals with conspiratorial ideas surrounding alien visitations to Earth, the sinister governmental Men in Black, and the involvement of these elements in well-known biblical narratives. This was not the first time The Stranglers had used this concept; \"Meninblack\" on the earlier \"The Raven\" album and subsequent 1980 single-release \"Who Wants the World?\" had also explored it, though not to the same level.",

They played the Hollywood clubs quite a bit at that time, and were regular patrons of Rodney Bingenheimer's club on Sunset. Jon and Michael Monarch later formed Detective with Michael Des Barres from Silverhead and signed with Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records. Jon was the drummer for Detective but wrote most of the lyrics and material, as he was a lead singer himself. He did the drumming on the Hokus Pokus album as well.",
      "Wizzo Band\nWizzo Band was formed by Roy Wood after Wizzard split in 1975, fulfilling his ambitions to create an ensemble that was more jazz-orientated than rock or pop. The line-up included former Wizzard and Move member Rick Price (pedal steel guitar), alongside Bob Wilson (trombone), Billy Paul (alto and baritone saxes), Paul Robbins (keyboards, backing vocals), Graham Gallery (bass), and Dave Donovan (drums).A lot of people had been doing jazz-rock stuff. There had been jazz musicians getting into the rock field, like Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke, but it's very rare that you find a band doing it the other way around a rock and roll band getting into jazz, and it's quite interesting. The rhythm section is very heavy, almost Zeppelinish, the horns are very jazzy and the songs are very commercial, so it makes for quite an interesting combination.",

      "The Jitterbug\n\"The Jitterbug\" was a song sung by Dorothy, together with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, that was cut from the soundtrack of the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\". It was both a jazzy development of the plot and a nod to the then-popular bobby-soxer dance craze. As the song begins, the four friends see a jitterbug flitting in the shadows from tree to tree and become frightened. The refrain that they sing is: \"Oh, the bats and the bees and the breeze in the trees have a terrible, horrible buzz. ... So, be careful of that rascal/Keep away from The Jitterbug.\" The Jitterbug puts a magical influence on the characters, forcing them to dance the Jitterbug frenetically. Soon there are many jitterbugs, and eventually, everyone collapses from exhaustion and are subdued by the Witch's army of flying monkeys.",

There was no official title given to the album at the time. The line \"the kid's no good\", which the album is commonly titled on several bootleg releases, is also featured in the Bee Gees song \"Come Home Johnny Bridie\" on the 1973 album \"Life in a Tin Can\". The album features orchestral arrangements by Bill Shepherd who performed the same role for the Bee Gees from 1965 to 1972 (Robin and Maurice Gibb's solo recordings were done with different arrangers).",
      "Just Good Old Rock and Roll\nJust Good Old Rock and Roll is the fifth studio album by The Electric Prunes, released in 1969. It was recorded with a lineup put together by Wilson-Fisher management for David Hassinger, who owned the name, during a period in which the original group was disbanded. This album took the Prunes' music decidedly away from the previous experimentation and underground psychedelia into (as the title suggests) more driving rock music. While there are elements of mild psychedelia present, the group's new direction pointed towards the boogie-rock that would be further developed in the 1970s by bands such as the James Gang and Foghat.",
      "The Aerovons\nThe Aerovons were an American psychedelic rock music group. They were formed in 1966 in St Louis, Missouri by Tom Hartman. A 1967 demo record was heard by a representative of Capitol Records. In spite of an offer to record in Los Angeles, the group held out hope that they could record in London, the recording home of their heroes, The Beatles. In 1968 they travelled to London twice, receiving offers from both EMI and Decca. In 1969, the band returned to London and recorded an album at Abbey Road studio. Guitarist Bob Frank, a longtime member of the group, left the group just before they went to London to record, due to personal issues. Despite blogs and rumors to the contrary, Bob was never \"let go\" and was always missed, according to leader Tom Hartman. Only once in England did the band realize that his replacement, Phil Edholm, and the group had differences that proved insurmountable. He left shortly after they began recording.",

It appears that this album may have been released rather quickly after their first album because that album had been only the second Liberty Records release of 1967 to actually make the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, the first being Gary Lewis & the Playboys \"You Don't Have To Paint Me A Picture\" LP, which charted in February. Unfortunately, \"Ricochet\" would fail to make the charts. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (aka The Dirt Band) is notable for having many additional charting albums and singles.",
      "In the Still of the Night (album)\nIn the Still of the Night is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released in August 1989 by Columbia Records and continues the trend that began with his 1986 collaboration with Henry Mancini, \"The Hollywood Musicals\", in that the project is devoted to a specific theme that ties the songs together. Mathis hints at the theme for this album in the liner notes for his 1993 box set \"The Music of Johnny Mathis: A Personal Collection\", where he gives his thoughts on the 1964 Little Anthony and the Imperials song \"I'm on the Outside Looking In\" that he covered for his 1988 album \"Once in a While\": \"That was group singers' kind of material. I was singing other stuff. It wasn't the picture of the lone crooner standing in the spotlight. That's what I was doing when all this other stuff was going on. I never listened to it until it was brought to my attention by [that album's producers] Peter Bunetta and Rick Chudacoff.\" Mathis chose to continue his work with Bunetta and Chudacoff on this project, which focuses on \"this other stuff\" that Mathis refers to: pop and R&B hits from the 1950s and 1960s.",

(It was also issued as the B-side to Bowie's January 1971 \"Holy Holy\" single.) An upbeat blues-rock number, \"Black Country Rock\" has been described as a \"respite\" from the musical and thematical heaviness of the remainder of the album. Its style has been compared to Marc Bolan's contemporary Tyrannosaurus Rex, down to Bowie's imitative vibrato in the final verse. According to producer Tony Visconti, Bowie had the music ready by the start of the sessions but the words were a last-minute addition in the studio, the singer doing his Bolan impression \"spontaneously ... because he ran out of lyrics ... we all thought it was cool, so it stayed.\"",

The essay, which talks about what is today called garage rock, contains the phrase, \"...punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound.\" This is believed to be one of the first uses of the word \"punk\" to refer to a type of rock music. A large section of the essay is concerned with the imagined longer career of the garage band the Count Five, after their hit \"Psychotic Reaction\". The band split after one album, but Bangs' discussion of the imagined subsequent records is entirely fanciful.",
      "Batman! (Jan and Dean song)\n\"Batman!\" is a song recorded by Jan and Dean. The song, heavily inspired by Neal Hefti's 1966 \"Batman Theme\" was from a Batman tribute album called \"Jan and Dean meet Batman\".

The music journalist Stuart Maconie commented \"he usually wore a jumpsuit made of the foil that you baste your turkeys in and platforms of oil-rig-derrick height. All of this though paled in comparison with his coiffure, a sort of demented tonsure with a great scooping fringe. He even had one outfit around 1973 famously called his 'Metal Nun' suit but later styles were much toned down.\"",
      "Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends\nLord Sutch and Heavy Friends is the debut album of English rock singer Screaming Lord Sutch. Recording began in May 1969 at Mystic Studios in Hollywood and it was released on Cotillion Records in 1970. The album featured an all-star line-up with contributions from Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page (who also produced the album) and John Bonham, guitarist Jeff Beck, session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, session guitarist Deniel Edwards and Jimi Hendrix Experience bass-player Noel Redding. Rick Brown and Carlo Little were previously with The Savages. Many of the musicians who played for Sutch on this album had grave misgivings upon its release. They were under the assumption these were demo quality recordings. As a result the artists disowned the project and the album sold poorly. It also seriously damaged Sutch's reputation with the musicians involved. \"I just went down to have a laugh, playing some old rock 'n' roll, a bit of a send-up. The whole joke sort of reversed itself and became ugly,\" Jimmy Page said of the record.",

Her fans are bound to consider this package a “must” buy, and deejays will find it a perfect programming for romantic wax segs.\"",
      "Cedric Myton\nCedric Myton (born 1947 in Old Harbour, Jamaica), is a Reggae musician and Rastafarian. Cedric Myton began his singing career with the group The Bell Stars, who recorded one single 45\" \"over and over\", the record was a minor success. This record was released in 1967. Alongside Lincoln Thompson, \"preps\" Lewis, and Devon Russell, Cedric Myton formed \"The Tartans\" in 1968, the group released many 45\" singles, and had early success in 1969 with the hit 45 \"Dance All Night\". After a couple of years The Tartans disbanded, and Myton alongside Lincoln \"Prince\" Thompson, formed \"The Royal Rasses\". Cedric Myton spent almost 3 years alongside Thompson, writing the tracks which would constitute the Royal Rasses album \"Humanity\". Cedric Myton also sang on every track on the album \"Humanity\". This album was a big success, although Cedric Myton left The Royal Rasses shortly after the release of \"Humanity\", his beautiful falsetto tones on every track, undoubtedly brought many fans to the attention of \"The Royal Rasses\" and the band continued without Cedric Myton, who went on to form \"The Congos\", alongside Roydel Johnson, who had a rich \"tenor\" and Watty Burnett who provided a \"Deep Barritone\", which combined with Cedric Mytons rich \"Falsetto\" anchored The Congos, whose music is easily distinguishable and highly regarded in not just reggae circles but worldwide. Unfortunately, due to both a dispute between the producer Lee\"Scratch\"Perry and Island Records favouritism of Bob Marley,the great first release LP from The Congos \"Heart Of The Congos\" was \"Shelved\" because it was deemed \"a strong album\" and Island Records.led by Chris Blackwell felt \"Heart Of The Congos\" would take away the limelight from Bob Marley. Many years later the English group \"The Beat\" released \"Heart Of The Congos\" on their own \"Go-Feat\" label, as did the company \"Blood And Fire\", and \"Heart Of The Congos\" was a big success,and rightly so, however it has to be said that had the album been released when it was first recorded it would have been a massive success. Instead it was released initially in very limited numbers on Lee Perry's \"Black Art\" label and Perry re-mixed the album adding various external sounds, such as \"cow Horns\" provided by the barritoned Burnett. They recorded the album \"Heart of the Congos\", with Lee Perry at the controls, producing what is widely considered one of the great classics of reggae. Later Myton pursued a solo career. After some time, the Congos reformed and recorded an album titled, \"Back in the Black Ark\". The group toured as well, appearing at music festivals such as the 2012 Rototom Sunsplash.",

    "docs": [
      "Fredric Rieders\nFredric Rieders (July 9, 1922 – November 26, 2005) was an internationally renowned forensic toxicologist. He was born in Vienna, Austria. He was most well known for his testimony in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, where he testified that presence of detectable amounts of the preservative EDTA found in blood at the scene indicated that it may not have come from a human being, but possibly was planted. Some of his other well-known cases include the Robert Curley case, in which Curley’s wife, Joann, poisoned him with thallium; another case is that of Michael Swango, or “Dr. Death”—a serial killer who killed as many as 60 of his patients at various hospitals he worked at using succinylcholine and epinephrine.",

The four Austrian women were nurse's aides at the Geriatriezentrum am Wienerwald in , Vienna who murdered scores of patients between 1983 and 1989. The group killed their victims with overdoses of morphine or by forcing water into the lungs. By 2008, all four of the aides had been released from prison.",

Neri with art by Randy DuBurke, published by Lee and Low Books in August, 2010 (ISBN  ). The story is about Robert “Yummy” Sandifer, who was eleven years old in 1994 when he became a fugitive from justice after killing a neighbor girl while he was shooting at somebody else during a gang initiation. Neri creates a fictional narrator who watches what happens to Yummy when he seeks help from the gang he is trying to impress. Instead, they turn on him when he becomes too much of a liability to them. The book asks hard questions: Was Yummy a thug who got what he deserved? Or was he just as much a victim as the girl he killed? As our hero says, “I tried to figure out who the real Yummy was. The one who stole my lunch money? Or the one who smiled when I shared my candy with him? I wondered if I grew up like him, would I have turned out the same?”\"",

Prosecution offices carried on several investigations into the cases for many years. The courts reached the conclusion that the murders were not committed by a single person but by a group of at least four perpetrators, who became later known as \"the picknick comarades\", and were definitively convicted. The 1968 murder was found to be a case unrelated to the others, albeit that the gun, that probably originally belonged to small local criminality, might be the same involved in the actual Monster cases.",

      "Florence, Idaho\nFlorence is a ghost town in Idaho County, Idaho, United States. About 14 air miles (22 km) east-northeast of present-day Riggins in remote north central Idaho at an elevation of 6080 ft . It was settled as a mining camp in the winter of 1861. Almost concurrent with its settlement, Washington Territory established Idaho County on December 20, 1861 in anticipation of a gold rush that brought over 9,000 residents within the first year., The town quickly became the seat with the first district court taking place at Florence on 22 September 1862. While the rich placer gold fields in the Florence Basin brought thousands of prospectors and contributed to the establishment of Idaho Territory in 1863, the rush to Florence was short-lived as intensive mining depleted the richest ground. At the first census of Idaho Territory, only 575 residents remained. By the territorial census of 1864, the population dwindled further to 254 residents. Even in its decline, Florence continued as the county seat until 1 June 1869 when the territorial legislature moved the county seat to the Warren's Camp settlement of Washington. The town thrived again from 1895–1900, based more on lode mining. Then the town slowly faded away, having only ten inhabitants in 1940, and was totally abandoned sometime after 1951.",

      "Zachary Onyonka\nDr. Zachary T. Onyonka (1939 -1996) was a Kenyan politician. Onyonka was the foreign minister of his country from 1969 to 1996 under several other ministries up to and including Education, Economic Planning & Development and Trade and Foreign Affairs. Well Known within the Kisii community, he was always at loggerheads with then Nyaribari chache MP Simeon Nyachae until he died. Onyonka was elected to parliament in the 1969 elections from Kitutu West Constituency when he trounced the first cabinet minister from Kisii, Lawrence Sagini Ndemo. He was the youngest MP at about 25 years. He retained his parliamentary seat until his death. He was famous for leading an anti-Nyachae crusade in Kisii after he was released from Kodiaga prison in Kisumu. He had been arrested and charged with murder following a fatal shooting incident involving his bodyguards and a voter in then Kiututu West constituency campaigns. Ouru Ndege was shot dead after he attempted to attack Dr. Onyonka with a knife during the stormy 1983 campaigns along Kisii-Migori junction. His rival, John Bosco Mboga had just addressed his supporters in the area and when Onyonka, who was a cabinet minister in President Moi's government arrived, Ndege attempted to stub him with a sword leading to the minister's bodyguards shooting him to death. Onyonka and his guards apparently did not have a car at the time of the shooting. He was rescued by a matatutu driver, Joseph Moya Nyambariga, from Botoro area in Bomorenda, Bonchari, who drove the sieged minister in his matatu, christened Boringo Na Nagi Express to safety at Suneka Chief's camp. He was arrested soon after and locked up in Kisumu awaiting trial on murder charges. The prosecution was unable to prove the case against him and in 1984, Onyonka was set free. He had won the hotly contested election in absentia and after two years in the cold, Moi appointed him Minister for Foreign Affairs. Before the 1988 elections, Onyonka led a group of politicians from Kisii dubbed the Four Os. This stands for Onyonka, Obure (Chris from Bobasi) Omanga (Andrew from Nyaribari Chache) and Onyancha (David from West Mugirango) to launch the famous \"Kebirigo Declaration\" in which Nyachae was denounced and consigned into political Siberia. The Kebirigo declaration was a strong political ideology that stood for independence of each constituency in Kisii against manipulation from Nyachae. At that time, it had become increasingly evident that Nyachae who was a powerful civil servant was planning to plunge into active politics. Onyonka alleged that Nyachae had embarked on a series of secret campaigns, recruiting candidates against incumbent MPs so that he could make it to parliament with a clean slate of leaders, if he was cleared by KANU to run for elective seat. The Kebirigo declaration was therefore meant to assert the authority and legitimacy of each member of parliament from Kisii and also sought to reject the political dominion from Nyaribari, Nyachae's home constituency. After Onyonka's death in 1996, he was succeeded by Jimmy Nuru Angwenyi as MP for Kitutu Chache. His son Richard Momoima Onyonka, later dethroned Angwenyi to become the area MP. After the 2013 electoral review, Kitutu Chache was hived into two constituencies, North and South (Mosocho).",

The discrediting of the case against Lucas for crimes in which Toole had offered corroborating statements created doubts as to whether either was a genuine serial killer or, as Hugh Aynesworth suggested, both were merely compliant interviewees whom police used to clear unsolved murders from the books. Toole received two death sentences, but on appeal they were commuted to life imprisonment. He died in his cell from cirrhosis, aged 49. Police attributed the murder of Adam Walsh to Toole on the basis of recanted statements. Lucas had backed Toole's confession to the Walsh murder, claiming he had been in possession of the victim's severed head.",
      "Death of Abdul Wali\nAbdul Wali was an Afghan man who died in US custody on June 21, 2003 at the age of 28. At the time of his death, he had been held for three days at the US base 10 miles south of Asadabad, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on suspicion of involvement in a rocket attack on the same base. The cause of his death was at first reported to be a heart attack, but this came into question when three members of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division came forward to testify that CIA contractor David Passaro assaulted Wali. Passaro, a former U.S. Army Ranger, allegedly beat Wali for two consecutive nights, causing grievous injuries including a fractured pelvis. Prosecutors would charge that Passaro ordered soldiers not to allow Wali to sleep, limited his access to food and water and subjected him to two consecutive nights of interrogation and beatings. Among other injuries, Wali suffered a suspected fractured pelvis that would have made it impossible for him to urinate. Witnesses testified that during one session Passaro, while wearing combat boots, kicked Wali in the groin hard enough to lift him off the ground, threw Wali to the ground, beat Wali on the arms and legs with a heavy Maglite flashlight, and that Passaro also vigorously thrust a flashlight into Wali's abdomen. After the second night of beatings, Wali begged the soldiers to kill him and moaned a phrase that meant, \"I'm dying.\" Wali died on his fourth day in custody. He repeatedly denied any involvement in the rocket attacks.",

      "Spring Creek raid\nThe Spring Creek raid, also known as the Tensleep Murders or the Tensleep Raid, occurred in 1909 and was the last serious conflict during the Sheep Wars in Wyoming, as well as the deadliest sheep raid in the state's history. On the night of April 2, the sheepherder Joe Allemand and four of his associates were encamped along Spring Creek, near the town of Ten Sleep, when a group of seven masked cattlemen attacked them. It remains uncertain as to whether or not an exchange of gunfire took place between the two parties, but evidence suggests that Allemand and two of his men were executed while the remaining two escaped unharmed. Two sheep wagons were also destroyed by fire and about two dozen head of sheep were shot to death. Seven men were arrested for the crime, two of whom turned state's evidence and were acquitted. The rest were found guilty and sent to prison for sentences ranging from three years to life in prison. The conviction of the Tensleep murderers effectively put an end to the killings on the open range and exemplified the arrival of law and order in a region that still retained its rugged frontier environment after the end of the 19th century. Although there continued to be sheep raids in Wyoming into the 1910s, there were no more deaths.",

Although initially Brinkley promoted this procedure as a means of curing male impotence, eventually he claimed that the technique was a virtual panacea for a wide range of male ailments.

      "Williams sisters\nThe Williams sisters are two professional American tennis players: Venus Williams (b. 1980), a seven-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), and Serena Williams (b. 1981), twenty-three-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), both of whom were coached from an early age by their parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price. There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals. They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\". Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7). By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam. At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively. Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics. Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No. 1 doubles players on 7 June 2010. Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles. Their most recent grand slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon & 2016 Wimbledon events. They remain very close, often watching each other's matches in support, even after one of them has been knocked out of a tournament.",

In 2009 Roger Federer had a large lead among voters working in the media, but viewers voted for Didier Cuche, giving him the awards. Even Cuche was surprised and in his speech he apologized to Federer, saying \"I hope he's not too angry...\" Federer didn't really bother, but he did the first time this happened.

      "Lee–Lin rivalry\nThe Lee–Lin rivalry is between two legendary badminton players, Datuk Wira Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia and Lin Dan of China. The rivalry is considered to be one of, if not, the greatest rivalry in badminton history. More often than not, the dominance of the two legendary shuttlers have been compared to that of tennis greats Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in tennis. They have played a total of 38 times, and Lin Dan leads their rivalry 26–12. Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan are by far the two of the most dominant players across three generations and many regard Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei as the 2 greatest badminton players of all time. In their homeland, each hold a military rank, with Lee a Commander (Honorary) of the Royal Malaysian Navy Volunteer Reserve Unit and Lin a retired Lieutenant-Colonel in the People's Liberation Army having being promoted from the ranks of Lieutenant-Commander and Major respectively, meaning they have the same seniority in terms of military rank. They have contested in many major tournament finals and are currently the only two badminton singles players who have contested in two Olympic finals where Lin Dan won both of the time. They have also contested two BWF World Championships finals and one Asian Games final where all matches were very close hard fought 3 setters and won by Lin Dan. There 2011 World Badminton Championship match widely touted as one of the greatest badminton matches of all the time. In the semi-finals of the 2016 Rio Olympics, most possibly the last Olympic Games of both athletes' careers, Lee Chong Wei won against Lin Dan, for the first time on the Olympic stage, making Lee the second shuttler in any discipline of the sport in history to reach 3 consecutive finals after Fu Haifeng who had achieved the feat a few hours earlier in the men doubles. The two players exchanged a special moment in their rivalry and exchanged shirts as they exited the court. The 2016 Rio Games marks an end in the badminton era dominated by Lee and Lin. Nevertheless, the pair are good friends off court, having invited one another to each other's wedding and sharing a mutual love for fast cars and watches. Among the cars that Lee owns include a crystal grey Bentley Continental GT, a white Audi R8, a white Ferrari F430, a grey Nissan Skyline GTR, Range Rover Evoque, yellow Lamborghini Aventador and a BMW X6 besides the cars given to him by national automaker Proton. Lin, on the other hand, has a Porsche Panamera, a grey Aston Martin DBS and also a black Nissan Skyline GTR among his vast collection of supercars.",

The point of the analogy is that a national and international institution (the All England Club) can be highly successful despite the lack of strong native competition, as in modern tennis Britain has produced very few Wimbledon champions, with only Ann Haydon Jones, Virginia Wade (both women's singles), Jonathan Marray (men's doubles), Andy Murray (men's singles), John Lloyd, Jeremy Bates, Jo Durie, Jamie Murray and Heather Watson (mixed doubles) winning titles in the Open Era.",

Rossi searched for some time and had difficulty casting the lead. \"I'd find someone who looked like him and had those aspects, but they wouldn't be a good athlete,\" said Rossi. \"I'd play catch with them, have them swing the bat. I didn't think we'd find all of those components.\" Richard Rossi appears in a supporting role playing the part of the agent \"Birddog,\" who persuaded Clemente to leave the Brooklyn Dodgers to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Clemente made his Pittsburgh debut in 1955 and went on to be named to 12 all-star teams while leading the National League in batting four times, winning one most valuable player award and two World Series rings.",

      "Santa Claus in film\nMotion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre. Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children. In 1897, in a short film called \"Santa Claus Filling Stockings\", Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys. Another film called \"Santa Claus and the Children\" was made in 1898. A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled \"Santa Claus\" (or \"The Visit from Santa Claus\" in the United Kingdom) was created. In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree. He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children. After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney. \"Santa Claus' Visit\" in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers. The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room. Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children. He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace. He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts. The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs. A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled \"A Trap for Santa Claus\" shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune. A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled \"Santa Claus\", by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer. A year later, another movie titled \"Santa Claus\" was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm. Over the years, various actors have donned the red suit (aside from those discussed below), including Monty Woolley in \"Life Begins at Eight-thirty\" (1942), Alberto Rabagliati in \"The Christmas That Almost Wasn't\" (1966), Dan Aykroyd in \"Trading Places\" (1983), Jan Rubes in \"One Magic Christmas\" (1985), David Huddleston in \"\" (1985), Jonathan Taylor Thomas in \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" (1998), and Ed Asner in \"Elf\" (2003).

      "Martin Gang\nMartin Gang ((1901--) 12, 1901 – (1998--) 29, 1998 ) was an American lawyer who fought against the 1940s and 1950s Hollywood blacklist. From 1931 to his death, he was a partner in the American law firm now known as Gang, Tyre, Ramer, and Brown (originally Gang, Kopp, and Brown). In the 1950s, Gang was known for providing legal representation to movie industry workers who cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee and was a leading member of the American Jewish Committee. He was portrayed in the 1991 movie \"Guilty by Suspicion\". One of the McCarthy era's most frequent \"clearance\" lawyers in Hollywood, Gang developed methods for ensuring that admitted but publicly repentant former communists could avoid studio blacklists and continue working in Hollywood. He counseled his clients to cooperate with the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), to admit their connection to communism, to fully repudiate their former beliefs, and to tell HUAC what they knew about former friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who were involved in communist groups. Counseling clients to \"name names\" is without question the most controversial and puzzling aspect of Gang's career. How could a lifelong liberal and founding member of the National Lawyer's Guild have been involved with facilitating and legitimatizing the work of HUAC? Gang himself thought he was merely zealously representing the interests of his client who simply wanted to keep working. HUAC already had the names so none of the people he counseled to cooperate with HUAC were damaging anyone who wasn't already implicated. But to cooperate with a witch hunt and to legitimize the witch hunters by cooperating with them is a bizarre legacy for a man of Martin Gang's stature and liberal bona fides.",

      "48 Hudson Avenue\n48 Hudson Avenue (also known as the Van Ostrande–Radliff House) is the oldest building in the city of Albany, New York. It was believed by Paul Huey, in the Albany architectural guide of 1993, to have been built in 1759 by Johannes Radliff when he married Elizabeth Singleton because he believed it was built after the stockade was moved south by one block. Research done by Albany historian John Wolcott proved that it had been occupied by Johannes van Ostrande between 1728 and 1734 and that a mortgage Radliff had on the house referred to it as \"formerly van Ostrande.\" The Lamont-Doherty Earth Sciences laboratory of Columbia University performed dendrochronology on a wood core sample from the building to confirm that the building dated from 1728.

      "Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor\nBenedict Arnold: A Question of Honor is a 2003 American television film directed by Mikael Salomon and starring Aidan Quinn, Kelsey Grammer, Flora Montgomery and John Light. It portrays the career of Benedict Arnold in the American Revolutionary War and his dramatic switch in 1780 from fighting for American Independence to being a Loyalist trying to preserve British rule in America. Arnold's relationships with his wife Peggy Shippen and the British officer John Andre are focused on. The friction between Arnold and General Horatio Gates, portrayed near the beginning of the film (for example, in one scene when Arnold derisively refers to him as \"Granny Gates\"), was historically accurate. The movie points out that, before his treason, Arnold was considered a patriot and a hero. A letter from General Washington is read at the beginning where he enthusiastically recommends Arnold for promotion saying that there is no general in the army more deserving and even comparing him to Hannibal. The movie briefly documents Arnold's final years of exile in England in which he laments his treasonous acts, realizing that he is despised and that people compare him with Judas and Lucifer.",

Brunello undertakes to steal it and sets off for the fortress of Albracca where not only does he manage to snatch the ring but also robs King Sacripante of his horse (from right underneath him) and the female warrior Marfisa of her sword. Marfisa sets off in pursuit but Brunello evades her and gives the ring to Agramante, who rewards him with a kingdom. The Saracens find Ruggiero at Mount Carena where they see him behind a wall of glass. However, the wall is too steep and slippery to climb, so Brunello suggests they trick Ruggiero out. He gets them to play war games in the plain beneath the mountain. Ruggiero, with his inherent love of combat, cannot resist and in spite of Atlante's pleas he leaves the garden and begs Brunello for his horse and armour. Brunello only agrees if he will join their expedition against France, to which Ruggiero happily consents.",

      "Walternienburg-Bernburg Culture\nWalternienburg-Bernburger Kultur refers to a mid-neolithic culture which was focused on the area of modern Saxony-Anhalt, the Thuringian Basin and Franconia from 3200 to 2800 BC. It consisted of two regional groups, Walternienburg and Bernburg which interacted closely with each other. Both are named after burial sites in Saxony-Anhalt. Alfred Götze identified the Berburg type in 1892 and the Walternienburg in 1911. Nils Åberg linked them together as the Walternienburg-Bernburg Culture in 1918, as two closely connected or completely co-extensive cultures. This suggestion is no longer valid, however, since the two cultures have clearly distinct funerary and burial practices. The earlier large stone graves attributed to the Walternienburg culture are today assigned to the Tiefstichkeramik culture and the shape of pottery belonging to the Walternienburg culture shows that it was in the Tiefstichkeramik tradition.",

During his appointment at the manor house Lundbæk at Nibe, he rode a horse, but it threw him off and he broke his leg.

      "Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen\nJørgen-Frantz Jacobsen  (November 29, 1900 – March 24, 1938) was a Faroese writer. He has a distinct place in Scandinavian literature, as he is the only Faroese writer to achieve international best-seller status. This status derives from his sole novel, \"Barbara: Roman\" (1939; translated, 1948 and 1993), which has the added cachet of being one of the few Scandinavian novels to be translated twice into English within the space of fifty years. The novel was translated into five other languages shortly after the first edition in the Danish language. It was also adapted as a motion picture directed by Nils Malmros in 1997 (see \"Barbara\"). These facts, together with Jacobsen's essays, a study of the Faroe Islands published in the guise of a travel guide, and a volume of his letters, are sufficient to suggest that had he lived longer, he would have been one of the outstanding literary figures in Scandinavia in the twentieth century. He was one of five Faroese writers, all born between 1900 and 1903, who represented a remarkable blossoming of literature in a country which had no tradition of literature in a modern sense. Jacobsen, together with William Heinesen, Christian Matras, Heðin Brú, and Martin Joensen, created modern Faroese literature, whether writing in Danish, as did Jacobsen and Heinesen, or the Faroese language, as did the others.",

      "Prefontaine\nPréfontaine is a family surname of French-Canadian origin. All Préfontaines in North America are descended from Antoine Fournier \"dit Préfontaine\" (born in 1663 in Picardie, France; died in 1702 in Montréal, Canada). He was a French soldier and a barrel cooper by trade in the Compagnie de Troyes, Troupes de la Marine. At the time it was common for French soldiers to adopt a nom de guerre often in reference to a trade, a place or a military rank. Antoine's nom de guerre was \"dit Préfontaine\", French for \"field (\"pré\") with a spring (\"fontaine\")\". He arrived in New France in August 1685 and took part in Chevalier Pierre de Troyes successful raid on several English trading posts in the Hudson Bay and James Bay regions from March to October 1686 (Hudson Bay expedition (1686)). He married Marie Ronceray in 1688 in Longueuil, Québec. Antoine's only son, Adrien (1693–1760), was an important businessman and a major figure in the economic development of New France. Adrien in turn had a son by the same name, who was a slave owner and was killed at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759. By the early-to-mid-19th century, the various families descended from Antoine dropped the Fournier part of the surname in favour of Préfontaine. Two brothers from Longueuil, Québec, Alexis and Toussaint Fournier dit Préfontaine, participated in the initial engagement of the Lower Canada Rebellion, the Chambly Road incident of November 17, 1837. The rebels were inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, republicanism and the desire for responsible and representative government. Alexis, an officer in the militia, resigned his commission the day before joining the Rebellion. When the Rebellion collapsed in November 1838, and after proudly admitting their active participation, even under the possible penalty of death or exile, both brothers were to spend a year in jail along with 1,100 other Patriotes. Two of Toussaint's sons, Raymond and François-Xavier, went on to have notable careers in their respective professions (see below). During the second half of the 19th century, several Préfontaine families emigrated from Québec to New England, the Midwest and the North-West of the United States. Others emigrated to Western Canada, notably to Manitoba and Saskatchewan.",

Nobility were the first to take names that would be passed on from one generation to the next. Later, clergy, artisans and merchants in cities took heritable names. Family names (surnames) were still used together with \"primary patronyms\" (father's name plus an affix denoting relationship), which were used by all social classes. This meant that most families until modern times did not have surnames. Scandinavian patronyms were generally derived from the father's given name with the addition of a suffix meaning 'son' or 'daughter' or by occupation like Møller - ( Miller ) naming tradition remained commonly used throughout the Scandinavian countries during the time of surname formation.",

With four-part harmonies, a trumpet, trombone and flute alongside the traditional indie band, the sound is hard to describe, but they've settled with comparing it to an off shore oil rig explosion, but with less screams and a lot more trumpet. Having shared the stage with bands such as Heaven 17, Buzzcocks and Dog Is Dead, the band are well known for their massive live shows, which have been described as a \"Powerfully energetic set which could get the dead dancing, but with the most beautiful harmonies I've heard live in a long time\".",

This piece can be characterized by the rhythmic layering between vocal sections, which creates complexity and texture. Starting with a tenor voicing, the choir comes in intensely with \"Sing, Oh my Jesus.\" Expect a strong bass line that really highlights the depths of the male voice, while bringing the central theme to the forefront of the piece. Listen to the musical phrasing after the tenors sing \"Can't you feel the spirit\".

In the first part of the song, the lines he says in the verses are \"Kick your knees up\", \"'Round the chimney\", \"Flap like a birdie\", \"Up on the railing\", \"Over the rooftops\" and \"Link your elbows\" followed by an interlude. The interlude continues with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops and as Admiral Boom looks at them with the telescope, he thinks that they're Hottentots, so he orders Mr. Binnacle to make them scram with colorful fireworks. In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, \"They're at it again!\" and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan. As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an \"OW!\" and the chimney sweepers flip her.

Musically, the song takes its instrumentation from a slowed down backing track of \"A Sort of Homecoming\". The vocals are the result of producer Brian Eno encouraging lead singer Bono to improvise lyrics while listening to the music for the first time. During the sole performance, Bono assumed that this was a rough cut—something that could be tightened up, altered and corrected later. However, it was the pure improvisation and continuity of performance (as opposed to editing together several performances into one piece) that Eno was interested in, and it is this track that ended up on the final product.",
      "In the Heat of the Night (Ray Charles song)\n\"In the Heat of the Night\" is a 1967 song performed by Ray Charles, composed by Quincy Jones, and written by Marilyn Bergman and Alan Bergman for the film \"In the Heat of the Night\". As Matthew Greenwald of AllMusic states, the song \"opens the film and accompanying soundtrack with a slice of real, rural backwoods gospel. Lyrically, one of the key lines is 'In the heat of the night/I'm feeling motherless somehow,' which clearly illustrates the main character's dilemma of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The main melody is guided by Charles' funky piano work and is buttressed by then-session ace Billy Preston's powerful, soulful organ trills. The underlying sense of drama that is so much a part of the film is reflected perfectly in this song, and the Ray Charles Singers add to this with a stately grace. It's perfect listening for a midsummer night when the temperature is just a bit too hot for comfort.\"",

Cedric Myton began his singing career with the group The Bell Stars, who recorded one single 45\" \"over and over\", the record was a minor success. This record was released in 1967. Alongside Lincoln Thompson, \"preps\" Lewis, and Devon Russell, Cedric Myton formed \"The Tartans\" in 1968, the group released many 45\" singles, and had early success in 1969 with the hit 45 \"Dance All Night\". After a couple of years The Tartans disbanded, and Myton alongside Lincoln \"Prince\" Thompson, formed \"The Royal Rasses\". Cedric Myton spent almost 3 years alongside Thompson, writing the tracks which would constitute the Royal Rasses album \"Humanity\". Cedric Myton also sang on every track on the album \"Humanity\". This album was a big success, although Cedric Myton left The Royal Rasses shortly after the release of \"Humanity\", his beautiful falsetto tones on every track, undoubtedly brought many fans to the attention of \"The Royal Rasses\" and the band continued without Cedric Myton, who went on to form \"The Congos\", alongside Roydel Johnson, who had a rich \"tenor\" and Watty Burnett who provided a \"Deep Barritone\", which combined with Cedric Mytons rich \"Falsetto\" anchored The Congos, whose music is easily distinguishable and highly regarded in not just reggae circles but worldwide. Unfortunately, due to both a dispute between the producer Lee\"Scratch\"Perry and Island Records favouritism of Bob Marley,the great first release LP from The Congos \"Heart Of The Congos\" was \"Shelved\" because it was deemed \"a strong album\" and Island Records.led by Chris Blackwell felt \"Heart Of The Congos\" would take away the limelight from Bob Marley. Many years later the English group \"The Beat\" released \"Heart Of The Congos\" on their own \"Go-Feat\" label, as did the company \"Blood And Fire\", and \"Heart Of The Congos\" was a big success,and rightly so, however it has to be said that had the album been released when it was first recorded it would have been a massive success. Instead it was released initially in very limited numbers on Lee Perry's \"Black Art\" label and Perry re-mixed the album adding various external sounds, such as \"cow Horns\" provided by the barritoned Burnett. They recorded the album \"Heart of the Congos\", with Lee Perry at the controls, producing what is widely considered one of the great classics of reggae. Later Myton pursued a solo career. After some time, the Congos reformed and recorded an album titled, \"Back in the Black Ark\". The group toured as well, appearing at music festivals such as the 2012 Rototom Sunsplash.",

Hadju also quotes noted jazz arranger and composer Gil Evans as saying, \"From the moment I first heard 'Chelsea Bridge,' I set out to try to do that. That's all I did ... tried to do what Billy Strayhorn did.\" In an analysis of the piece's haunting melody, Gunther Schuller writes: \"What Strayhorn exploited in the theme of 'Chelsea Bridge' is the duality of its chromatic harmonies. The theme is set in its first three bars in minor sixth chords with an added major seventh. However, Strayhorn causes us to hear these harmonies as if they were whole-tone chords. He achieves this effect by two means: 1) through orchestrational and dynamic stressing of the three upper notes [and] 2) by setting these sixth chords in their third inversions. This latter device takes away the rootedness of the harmonies, letting them float, so to speak, more towards the top of their structure.\"",

An upbeat blues-rock number, \"Black Country Rock\" has been described as a \"respite\" from the musical and thematical heaviness of the remainder of the album. Its style has been compared to Marc Bolan's contemporary Tyrannosaurus Rex, down to Bowie's imitative vibrato in the final verse. According to producer Tony Visconti, Bowie had the music ready by the start of the sessions but the words were a last-minute addition in the studio, the singer doing his Bolan impression \"spontaneously ... because he ran out of lyrics ... we all thought it was cool, so it stayed.\"",

      "Bennington, Idaho\nBennington was one of the camping places for Indians that came through the Bear Lake valley each year on their hunting and fishing trips. They camped there until the 1930s, asking for food from the residents. An emigrant massacre happened at the mouth of four Mile Canyon. The emigrants head camp of the main road for better feed and plentiful water. A band of Shoshone led by \"Paughatello\" killed all the members of the company except for one 15-year-old boy, who hid in a wash and made his way back to another company. He went on to Oregon or California with the team. The battle spanned over 40 acres along the creek. Seven wagons, 20 people, 33 horses and 14 head of livestock were involved. Wagon parts, bones, cap and ball pistols, swords and other relics could be found decades later. The first town site of Bennington was located on block West on highway 30 at the Cemetery and Wright Roads, where the old Amos Wright log cabin still stands. The first settlers, Jared Bullock, and Jonathan Hoopes, came in the fall of 1864 and settled on the south side of Bennington Creek. Then Evan M. Greene, Hyrum Hoopes and Edmond Homer came. Six families spent the winter in 1864.In 1865 and 1866 more people were called to settle . In 1866 the community was officially named after a town in Vermont where Brigham Young once lived. In 1873 the town had a meeting, and the present town site was chosen. A church, school, store/post office and new homes were eventually built. Evan Green was the first Presiding Elder serving from 1864 to 1865, followed by Dudley Merrell, who presided until 1870, then Alonzo became the first Bishop. Church was held in a vacant house until one could be built. The first living white baby born Feb. 18, 1866 was Winnifred Rebecca Wright daughter of Amos R. Wright. The first death was Admanza Greene who died of pneumonia at age 10. Jared Bullock's wife died of childbirth. She was buried at the end of the haystack and then moved to the present cemetery later. Deep snow, cold weather and primitive living conditions made living here hard. A traveling band and a dancing academy taught by John Dunn was organized to help people get through the long winter mounts. In 1934 there was a terrible drought. At that time each home and building at the new town site had their own well. They all dried up except the one at the school so people carried water from there. The WPA helped with a new water system and during 1934-35 the men of the community dug ditches and laid the pipe to their homes. They had a big celebration at its completion in August 1936. Today Bennington is a thriving town with many new homes and a big church.",

In spite of severe criticism from the most \"purist\" amongst the critics and public, \"It hasn't been easy. First came the accusations of corruption of the music, of treachery in his struggle to disfigure what was already perfectly coded. When some albums and some categorical evidence of his knowledge of the classical approach laid these malicious comments bare, then came the most twisted condemnations. That the pace of the compás waned (just get a metronome and see for yourself), that he didn't really make you feel (are there really many true aficionados whose hair doesn't stand on end listening to his caña ‘Eso no lo manda la ley’, ‘La aurora de Nueva York’ or ‘Generalife’, to name three markedly different examples) and that kind of thing.\" he was perhaps the most influential contemporary flamenco singer, who not only innovated, but it could also be said that he created tradition: some of his \"cantes\" have been performed by other singers such as Camarón de la Isla, Mayte Martín, Carmen Linares, Miguel Poveda, Segundo Falcón and Arcángel.

      "Bernhard, schavuit van Oranje\nBernhard, schavuit van Oranje (English title: Bernhard, scoundrel of Orange) is a Dutch television program depicting the more than only turbulent life of a prince consort. It is a compelling drama concerning a man who tries to be himself, but must survive deep crises, finally to see the real meaning of love. Within the Dutch royal family there is actually no more talked about character than Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. Whether it concerns Greet Hofmans, extramarital affairs, or Lockheed, Prince Bernhard faced a lot of scandals throughout the course of his life. Besides this he was, and is a person, loved by many as a war hero. A man of extremes. In four parts Prince Bernhard tells the tale of his life. Not only through the spyglass, but especially to his grandson's wife, Princess Máxima of the Netherlands, who will be soon the Queen next to Prince Willem-Alexander.

      "Jose Tafoya\nJose Piedad Tafoya (1834 - ca. 1913), sometimes called the Prince of the Comancheros, was one of the more notable traders from New Mexico who traveled throughout the Southern Great Plains exchanging goods with the Comanches and their allies the Kiowa for stolen horses, cattle, and sometimes human captives. According to legend, he was seven feet tall. He was born in La Cuesta, New Mexico in 1834 and first visited the Great Plains as early as 1859. In the 1850s, he operated a sheep ranch in San Miguel County, New Mexico. His first wife was Maria de Jesus Perez. They married April 20, 1863 in Anton Chico, New Mexico. In the 1860s, he operated a trading post near what is now Quitaque, Texas. In the 1870s, he began sheep herding in Texas. He also at times acted as a scout for the US Army, possibly unwillingly. According to some sources, he was instrumental in the defeat of the Comanches at the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. He allegedly revealed the location of Comanche camps to Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie after being forced to do so either at the end of a rope or after being tied to a wagon wheel. Some believe that this story is mythical. Mackenzie credited another Comanchero scout named Johnson for finding the camps. Tafoya also participated in the ill-fated Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877. In 1879, he accompanied Lt. John L. Bullis on an expedition into southern New Mexico in pursuit of a band of marauding Lipan and Mescalero Apaches. By the 1880s, he had left Texas and was once again ranching sheep in New Mexico. He appeared in the U.S. Court of Claims in 1893 along with three other former Comancheros, where they admitted to having purchased cattle marked with brands belonging to Charles Goodnight and others. He had at least four children and probably died about 1913, when his will was filed, bequeathing his house to his second wife, Teresa Baca de Tafoya.",

In any event a second choice was requested and again sources vary. He may have named Huáscar half-brother Atahualpa who then refused, or named Huáscar himself, or perhaps even the nobles put forward Huáscar.

He was the nephew of Diebold Schilling the Elder of Berne. The younger Diebold was a somewhat scandalous figure, not unlike his father Hans, brother to the elder Diebold, an adventurer who had sought his fortune at the court of Matthias Corvinus, and returned destitute in 1488. Diebold was a secretary in Lucerne from 1479, and received the priesthood in 1481. His behaviour was so unpriestly, however, that the city council locked him into the tower in 1487, where he remained imprisoned for two years before he was released on parole of exhibiting more appropriate behaviour in the future. After his release he was soon back to his old ways, and after he had killed a man after a tavern brawl, he was fined and obliged to read a mass for his victim every year. Diebold was fiercely anti-French, and he accused the Bernese in particular, as well as his fellow chronicler Petermann Etterlin because of their friendly attitude towards France. Diebold's own sympathies lay with the German emperor Maximilian I, who personally invited him to the Reichstag in Konstanz in 1507. As an author, Diebold's most important contribution to the historiography of his times is his account of the years 1507–1509, the events of which he tells in his own words as an eye-witness.",

He is a Polish folk hero because, after he was denied permission to build a house on his own land (he was Polish and opposed to Germanization) by the Prussian authorities in the village of Kaisertreu, he bought a circus wagon and turned it into his home. At the time, Prussian law considered any dwelling a house if it remained stationary for more than 24 hours.

      "Laurentius Suslyga\nLaurentius Suslyga or Laurence Suslyga (\"Polish\": Wawrzyniec Suslyga) (1570–1640), was a Polish Jesuit historian, chronologist, and an author of Baroque visual poetry. He was the first person to claim that Jesus Christ was born in or before 4 BC, not in AD 1, as the Christian era would imply. Suslyga was thus questioning the Anno Domini chronology introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 525. Suslyga presented this theory in his 1605 doctoral thesis entitled \"Theoremata de anno ortus et mortis Domini, deque universa Jesu Christi in carne oeconomia\" at the University of Graz. Among other arguments, Suslyga's treatise included the following: Herod's son, Philip the Tetrarch, renamed a city (Bethsaida) after Augustus's biological daughter, Julia. Since she had been exiled from Rome by Augustus in 2 BC, Suslyga assumed that Philip must have renamed the city prior to that date, and Herod must have died prior to Philip's becoming a ruler, which pushes the Massacre of the Innocents at least 3, if not more, years before AD 1. Dionysius Exiguus' chronology did need to be questioned; his chronology did not even match the point of view of the early Christians. The Church Fathers generally believed that Jesus was born either in the 41st or 42nd year of the reign of Augustus (consulship, principate, etc.), that is in 3 or 2 BC.",

With Guitarist Ron Koss, keyboardist John Seanor, and drummer Larry Zack as the nucleus of a jazzy trio called Scarlet Letter (with two albums on Mainstream), the addition of vocalist/bassist Al Jacquez transformed the group into Savage Grace. The band was soon signed to Reprise and released their eponymous debut album in 1969. Upon moving to Los Angeles the following year, the group embarked on a second album, which took almost two years to complete. By 1972, the trail had ended and the group went their separate ways. Savage Grace never achieved the success that seemed like their due; certainly their musicianship was top notch and their songwriting was good enough, but in the long run, was also perhaps a bit too eclectic to find a mainstream audience.",

The significant element that distinguishes \"country folk\" from the \"folk\" music on Dylan's contemporaries' recordings in the 1960s was the re-admission of country and bluegrass music instrumentation--mandolin, banjo, fiddle, and resophonic and electric steel guitars--into the mix; country rock's success with urban audiences had paved the way for this hybrid.

      "Mental Overdrive\nMental Overdrive is the primary solo moniker of Per Martinsen (born 31 July 1966), one of Norway's most prolific and influential techno musicians. His tracks have ranged from hardcore rave techno to vibrant space-disco, and he's always maintained a healthy balance of humor and braininess. Active since 1990, he began his career releasing several 12\" EPs of aggressive, rave-ready hardcore techno on revered Belgian label R&S, including 12000 AD (1990), The Second Coming (1991), Move! (as Confusion Club, 1991), and The Love EP (1992). In 1994, Martinsen began releasing atmospheric techno singles as part of Illumination, his duo with Nicholas Sillitoe. The next year, Mental Overdrive released the single \"Disto Disco,\" which featured a B-side (\"Faith\") co-written by R&S artist Outlander, best known for the 1991 classic \"Vamp.\" The A-side appeared on Mental Overdrive's full-length debut Plugged, released on Martinsen's own Love OD Communications. The album showed a notable progression in his music, maintaining its rough, distorted hardcore techno sound while adding more cerebral elements, placing it closer to Warp's Artificial Intelligence series. Martinsen displayed his sense of humor with 1996's Unplugged, a limited conceptual release containing silent \"versions\" of the tracks on Plugged. 083 In 1997, Mental Overdrive signed to Virgin and released About Jazz, a significantly more house/disco-influenced EP than his previous work. This was followed by full-length Ad Absurdum, which continued in a more light-hearted and funky direction than his previous releases. He took a few years off from releasing Mental Overdrive recordings, instead devoting time to Frost (his more pop-focused electronic duo with his wife Aggie Peterson) and Illumination, which released two albums on RCA. Following the 2003 release of Mental Overdrive's Me EP on Love OD, he signed to Norwegian label Smalltown Supersound and released full-length 083, which featured the single \"Diskodans.\" In 2005, the label compiled his early R&S material on CD as The Phuture That Never Happened. Two years later, Mental Overdrive's single \"Spooks\" appeared on Prins Thomas' Full Pupp label. The song appeared on his next Smalltown full-length, You Are Being Manipulated, which was released in 2008. The album was perfectly at home with the label's other left-field dance artists like Bjørn Torske and Kim Hiorthøy, while maintaining the unique Mental Overdrive sound. Martinsen continued releasing Mental Overdrive singles on Full Pupp and Love OD, and contributed to Rune Lindbæk's Meanderthals project. In 2012, he released Man with a Movie Camera, an EP featuring music he'd composed for a 1996 screening of the Russian silent film of the same name, which also featured pieces by Biosphere which would later appear on the 2001 remaster of his classic album Substrata. Mental Overdrive returned to his Love OD label for 2013 full-length Cycls, as well as 2014's Everything Is Connected, which compiled a few previously released EPs. In 2016, Full Pupp sublabel Rett I Fletta released a new version of Plugged consisting of alternate takes sourced from the original DAT tapes. (Paul Simpson for allmusic.com)",

      "Martin H. Kennelly\nMartin Henry Kennelly (August 11, 1887 – November 29, 1961) was an American politician and businessman. He served as the 37th Mayor of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois from April 15, 1947 until April 20, 1955. Kennelly was a member of the Democratic Party. According to biographer Peter O'Malley, he was chosen as mayor by a scandal-burdened Democratic machine that neeed a reformer on top of the ticket. Kennelly was a wealthy businessman and civic leader, active in irish and Catholic circles. As a long-time opponent of machine politics he accepted the nomination on condition the machine would not pressure him for patronage and that he did not have to play a leadership role in the party. This gave him a non-partisan image that satisfied the reform element. As mayor he avoided partisanship and concentrated on building infrastructure and upgrading the city bureaucracy. He worked to extend civil service; he reorganized inefficient departments. The city took ownership of the mass transit system. He obtained federal aid for slum clearance and public housing projects and for new expressways construction. At his death Mayor Richard J. Daley, the party leader who defeated Kennelly in a bitter primary battle in 1955, called him, \"a great Chicagoan who loved his city\" and ordered City hall flags placed at half staff.",

He was widely honored during his lifetime, including in Great Britain and the United States, as a freedom fighter and bellwether of democracy in Europe.

The earliest marked stone is for Daniel Kinne who died in 1713. In the 1930s, the inscriptions of 79 stones in the Kinne Cemetery were recorded for the Hale Index. There are around 80 fieldstones with no carving or identification, but it is unknown if this stems from wearing of the gneiss stone or that there were no skilled carvers locally available. The seven carvers that have been identified are Lebbeus Kimball, Jotham Warren, Josiah Manning, Peter Barker, Mr. Huntington of Lebanon, E. Marston of Mystic Bridge and O. Doty of Stonington. The National Historic Register of Places nomination notes, \"the cemetery is significant artistically because the carving on the stones gives many good examples of the funerary art that was characteristic of the 18th and 19th centuries in New England.\" The cemetery is notable because of the burial of Isaac C. Glasko, the namesake of the village of Glasgo, and a prominent African American land-holding man who ran a blacksmith shop that was important to the marine industry of the area. The cemetery was made apart of the Connecticut Freedom Trail in 1995 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 12, 2001.",

      "Boiler Room Girls\nThe \"Boiler Room Girls\" were the female members of Senator Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign staff. The boiler room contained desks divided by regions of the country, i.e. Northeast (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine), etc. Each \"girl\" was assigned a regional desk and was responsible for daily communication in and out of the Washington campaign headquarters to each state director in their region. Issues and problems were discussed daily and at the end of the day a decision book was compiled and sent to the candidate (RFK) and the campaign manager (Stephen Smith). Decisions were reached on each daily issue and the following morning those decisions came out from the regional desk officer (\"boiler room girl\") to the state director. So if there was an issue with labor, or abortion rights or there weren't enough bumper stickers, etc. those issues were resolved. Also as each state primary was held, the desk officers kept track of the delegate count - both for RFK, McCarthy and Humphrey - leading up to the convention. Just before the Democratic National Convention the boiler room was to be moved to a temporary office right off the convention floor where the same delegate officers conversed with the same state leaders. Thus at any given moment, the boiler room became the heartbeat of the campaign.",

      "Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1924\nThe 1924 Democratic presidential primaries were part of the selection process by which voters of the Democratic Party chose its nominee for President of the United States in the 1924 U.S. presidential election. The concept of a primary election, where any registered party member would vote for a candidate, was relatively new in the American political landscape. In only 12 states were actual primaries held, and even in those the results were not universally binding for the delegates to the Democratic National Convention, where the presidential candidate would be formally chosen. In most of the country, the selection of delegates was confined to state-level conventions and caucuses, under the heavy hand of local political machines. Though William Gibbs McAdoo won a vast majority of states, and much more than half of the popular vote, in those twelve states that held primary elections, it meant little to his performance nationwide. Many of the delegations from states that did \"not\" hold primary elections favored his main rivals, Oscar Underwood of Alabama and Al Smith of New York, neither of which won any primary elections. As well, the primaries that McAdoo did not win were won by \"local sons\" who stood no chance of winning the nomination, or in some cases were not even formal candidates. Once at the convention, the party was deadlocked for 102 straight ballots, before dark horse candidate John W. Davis, (who was not a formal candidate when he arrived at the convention) was chosen on the 103rd ballot. Davis went on to lose the election to Republican candidate Calvin Coolidge."

In his review of the revue, David Sprague of \"Variety\" wrote: \"The book, built on fleshed-out codifications of the members’ road-tested stage banter, is somewhat slight, but the ratio of knee-slappers to groan-inducers is high enough to make it diverting.\" In the same review, he concluded, \"...given the Spankers’ remarkably deft musicianship and bottomless pit of material — bad breaks and bad brakes are both likely to be part of the touring band vernacular for some time to come — the revue would seem to have legs.\"",

      "Harry Kipper\nIn the '90s, the pseudonym \"Harry Kipper\" was appropriated and made into a fictional character invented by the multiple-identity underground movement Luther Blissett. The story was created and propagated that Harry Kipper, a British conceptual artist, had mysteriously gone missing on the Italian-Yugoslav border whilst on a biking tour of Europe, allegedly with the intention of tracing the word Art across the continent.

Shortly before the show was to be aired, it was revealed that Kipper and Blissett never existed and the episode had to be pulled off the air to the great embarrassment of the producers. This prank served a double purpose, first it demonstrated how easily the media are manipulated, and second, it introduced Luther Blissett as a figure that lives entirely in the media space.",

      "Hollywood on Television\nHollywood on Television was a five-and-a-half-hour, six-day-a-week live television talk show starring newcomer Betty White and radio disc jockey Al Jarvis that ran from 1949 to 1953. When Jarvis left the show in 1951, film star Eddie Albert took his place and co-hosted with White for six months until thirty-three and a half hours of live ad-lib television per week, featuring just the two of them, took its toll and he also resigned. White was then hosting the show alone, and is believed to have been the first female television talk show host as a result. After a period of White talking directly into the camera lens for hours at a stretch, the show began accepting guests to interact with her as well as gradually incorporating scripts and sketches. Similarly to Jackie Gleason's \"Honeymooners\" sketches on the Dumont Network during the same era, recurring sketches involving White as a housewife named Elizabeth caught on with the viewers to the point that expanding the sketches into a half-hour sitcom appeared to be the obvious next step. Series pianist George Tibbles began writing the sketches. Studio producer Don Fedderson, Tibbles and White formed a production company called \"Bandy Productions,\" named after Betty White's dog Bandit, and White changed over to a half hour sitcom format based on the Elizabeth sketches entitled \"Life With Elizabeth\", which ran in syndication for two years and sixty-five episodes. Across the decades, White would use the skills she had honed on \"Hollywood on Television\" by hosting her own talk show in 1954 and subsequent variety series as well as starring in numerous sitcoms, including \"Date with the Angels\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"The Betty White Show\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Golden Palace\" and \"Hot in Cleveland\", as well as hosting the 2012 prank show \"Betty White's Off Their Rockers\", which began airing 63 years after the premiere of \"Hollywood on Television\".",

His first creation for Jim Henson was Rowlf the Dog, which he built in 1962 for a series of Purina Dog Chow commercials. Don would go on to design and build most of the Muppet characters, including Bert and Ernie, Grover, and Cookie Monster among others. His character designs are often recognizable for their spheroid heads partially bisected to create large mouths. Although always based on sketches by Jim Henson, the Muppet founder regularly stated that it was Don who should be credited with creating the actual Muppet \"look\", and Henson later had a bench in London dedicated to his memory. The series finale of \"Fraggle Rock\" is also dedicated to him. After all the regular credits have been shown, a special credit appears which reads \"This show is for Don Sahlin\".",

      "Enlarged Double Lock No. 23, Old Erie Canal\nEnlarged Double Lock No. 23, Old Erie Canal is a historic Erie canal lock located at Rotterdam in Schenectady County, New York. It was built in 1841-1842 as part of the First Enlargement. It is built entirely of large cut limestone blocks, laid regular ashlar, and mortared with hydraulic cement. The Northeast lock chamber is 110 ft long and 18 ft wide; the Southwest lock chamber is 220 ft long and 18 to 20 ft wide; and the Center pier is 100 ft long and 26 ft wide. The Southwest lock chamber was expanded in 1889-1890. Lock 23 fell into disuse after the opening of the New York State Barge Canal in 1918. The lock chambers contain no water and the area is open as a local park. The site was reclaimed and stabilized by local volunteers starting in 1999. A replica of a board and batten locktender's hut was constructed between 2000 and 2003 by students from the Union College Department of Civil Engineering.",

      "Hillside Home School I\nIn March of 1887, Frank Lloyd Wright, having newly moved to Chicago to try to become an architect, received a letter from his aunt Ellen C. Lloyd Jones asking him to perhaps design a building for the school that she planned with her sister, Jane (\"Jenny\"). Biographer Meryle Secrest wrote about the letter from \"Aunt 'Nell'\" to Wright in her biography on the architect: The letter contains detailed instructions about floor plans... She added that some of her friends were contributing their architectural notions. The nephew seems to have cut them all out fast. His resulting designs were evidently derived from those of [Joseph Lyman] Silsbee [his then-employer], and one of his authorized biographies more or less acknowledges that this architect played the largest role. Wright dismissed his first attempt as \"amateurish.\" Nell Lloyd Jones asked her nephew to design this structure because she and Jenny were planning on beginning the Hillside Home School on land left to them by their father, in the town of Wyoming, Wisconsin (south of the town of Spring Green). This building, which became known as the \"Home Building\", was the first one designed specifically by Wright for the school, a coeducational day and boarding school which functioned until 1915. Silsbee had introduced the young Wright to the \"Shingle Style mixture of Queen Anne and Colonial elements.\" In 1907, Spring Green's newspaper, the \"Weekly Home News\", ran an article focused on the Hillside Home School institution, then in its twentieth year. In the section about the home building, the article stated that it:[C]ontains the parlors, in one of which there is a beautiful carved fireplace which at once attracts the attention of the visitor…. This building also contains the dining rooms, living rooms and kitchens, which are all modern and well-equipped. Besides these are twenty-two rooms which are occupied by the girls and some of the teachers. They are all large, well ventilated and sunny. The architecture of this building is English.The Home Building was the first of three structures that Wright would design for the Hillside Home School. In addition to the 1887 design, he was commissioned to design the Romeo and Juliet Windmill in 1896 and the Hillside Home School in 1901 (often referred to as Hillside Home School II to differentiate it from the 1887 structure).",

The bridge spans over Hook Creek, connecting the Nassau County community of Meadowmere Park and Meadowmere, Queens. According to a \"New York Times\" article by Sarah Kershaw, “the 75 foot bridge arches over Hook Creek, which runs through southeast Queens and into Nassau county, forming a border and feeding Jamaica Bay”. Half the bridge is on Long Island, the other half is in New York City. A picture taken by Charles Siebeneichen that is included in the Queens Library Digital Collection of 1926, shows a view from the bridge titled \"Hook Creek Off Bridge.” Many families, including the Charles Siebeneichen family], spent the summers on Hook Creek meadow (on the Queens side) from 1875 to 1926.",
      "The Anchorage (Marietta, Ohio)\nThe Anchorage is a historical home in the Harmar neighborhood of Marietta, Ohio, United States. Also known as the Putnam Villa, it was built in 1859 by Douglas Putnam for his wife Eliza. Douglas was the great grandson of General Israel Putnam. Douglas' brother, David Putnam, Jr. was the leading abolitionist in Marietta. David was said to frequent the home, leading to the belief the home was used as part of the Underground Railroad although no evidence has been uncovered. While I was an employee of the Nursing Home (called The Christian Anchorage), some of us went down in the basement to verify the stories about the underground railway. There were great tunnels which were said to lead to the Muskingum River. One was cemented over, but, in the middle of the night, you would see giant river rats sitting on the stairs or scampering across the floor.",

Walker was the first American female and first African-American female self-made millionaire, and \"the world's most successful female entrepreneur of her time.\" The mansion is an Italianate villa house designed for Walker by Vertner Tandy, the first African-American architect registered in New York, and has been considered to be one of his greatest works. It was constructed during 1916–1918 at an estimated cost of $250,000, and was furnished lavishly. The name Villa Lewaro was coined by a distinguished visitor, Enrico Caruso, from the first two letters of each word in Lelia Walker Robinson, the name of Walker's daughter, who later went by the name of A'Lelia Walker.",
      "Participants in the Madoff investment scandal\nInvestigators are looking for other participants in the Madoff investment scandal besides Bernard Madoff who were involved in the Madoff investment scheme, despite Madoff's assertion that he alone was responsible for the large-scale operation. Harry Sussman, an attorney representing several clients of the firm, stated that \"someone had to create the appearance that there were returns,\" and further suggested that there must have been a team buying and selling stocks, forging books, and filing reports. James Ratley, president of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners said, “In order for him to have done this by himself, he would have had to have been at work night and day, no vacation and no time off. He would have had to nurture the Ponzi scheme daily. What happened when he was gone? Who handled it when somebody called in while he was on vacation and said, ‘I need access to money’?”",

Koehler’s particular research interest in the identification, cellular structure and growth of wood gave him the specific training and abilities necessary for the careful examination of the ladder which had been used by the abductor of Charles Lindbergh, Jr., aged twenty months, and the tracing of the ladder to a company in McCormick, South Carolina. Koehler, from there, traced the wood of the ladder to a Bronx lumber yard.",

Alexander Gustaf Jan Ruhtenberg or Alexander Gustav Jan Ruhtenberg, born Alexander Gustaf Rutencrantz von Ruhtenberg, 28 February 1896 – died, December 1975) was an architect who \"made significant contributions in introducing modern architecture to the United States as a teacher and a modern architect\". Ruhtenberg was involved in the Bauhaus movement in Germany, studying under Mies van der Rohe and worked with Philip Johnson. In \"The International Style: Architecture Since 1922\" Johnson acknowledges Ruhtenberg as one of two “kind friends” who have read and criticized draft texts. Johnson and fellow author Henry-Russell Hitchcock included Ruhtenberg’s 1930 Berlin apartment house interior among their illustrations of modern design. In his biography of Philip Johnson, architectural historian Franz Schulze refers to Ruhtenberg as Johnson's new friend during the latter's travels in Germany in 1929. The two visited the Bauhaus in Dessau together. At the time Ruhtenberg was a public relations aide to designer Bruno Paul. Johnson, working with Henry-Russell Hitchcock, was gathering material for \"The International Style: Architecture Since 1922.\" Ruhtenberg was traveling with them. Schulze cites Johnson's letter of 17 September 1930 to J. J. P. Oud, a Dutch modernist architect, in which Johnson called Ruhtenberg his best friend, describing him as a beginning architecture student. Three years later in another letter to Oud, Johnson tells him that he is building a house in Manhattan with his friend Jan Ruhtenberg. He was active in many areas of country such as New York City with both his architectural skills (the renovation of 57 East 93rd Street that was reviewed by \"Architectural Forum\" in 1937); He is \"credited\" with the interior design of Nelson Rockefeller's Penthouse at 810 Fifth Avenue (62nd Street) by the New York Times;  and his opinions on the progressive housing movement which were recorded for the Library of Congress.",
      "Skinny House (Mamaroneck, New York)\nThe Skinny House in Mamaroneck, New York was built in 1932 by African-American carpenter and building contractor Nathan Thomas Seely on an extremely narrow lot of donated land after he lost his home to foreclosure and his company to bankruptcy during the early years of the Great Depression. The 10 ft wide house has 3 stories and was built on a 12.5 ft wide plot of land sold to him by his neighbor, to whom he had earlier sold a larger plot of land. The house was constructed entirely from salvaged materials. The New York State Board for Historic Preservation noted “its efficient and beautiful design, careful engineering, and effective interior plan. Challenged by a narrow lot and minimal financial means, Seely created a house that demonstrated both his ingenuity and the desire to provide, above all else, housing for his family.” The Westchester County Historical Society said “its professional construction and ingenious design are a testimony to the dedication of a prominent black contractor to build a solid, functional, and delightful home. It represents both black enterprise and good neighborliness, and is architecturally significant as a symbol of American ingenuity and craftsmanship.”",

McNulty elected to several successive terms as a United States Congressman. Jack McNulty is said to have been a \"co-congressman\" for the 2 decades that his son served in the U.S. Congress, before his retirement from the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008. A fellow Democrat, Jack was a staunch opponent of the entrenched old guard Albany County Democratic political machine Democratic Party (U.S.A.), which was run by Dan O’Connell and which in a political in-fight had unseated his father John J. McNulty, Sr. as Sheriff of Albany County, New York back in 1937. The high point of Jack's personal political career was when he recaptured that Sheriff's office, being, himself, elected Sheriff of the County of Albany, New York in 1973.

      "Rescue Hook and Ladder Co.1 Haverstraw NY\n“The origin of the department dates back to the burning of a barn in the lower part of the village on the property of George E. DeNoyelles on January 24, 1854. This event demonstrated the necessity of some sort of an equipped. And organized department, in order that the citizens of those days would be better able to guard their homes and property against the ravages of fire. The DeNoyelles fire occurred on a Sunday evening just as the late reverend A. S. Freeman was about to deliver his sermon. One of the congregation sitting near the door and hearing the alarm became so excited that he arose in his pew and shouted, “We are all on fire!” To tell it as the doctor afterwards described the incident: “There was a sudden vision of coat tails flying out behind and a precipitous retreat of men, women and children, and finding myself standing in the pulpit facing empty seats 1 concluded to suspend the services with the benediction.” Although the good people never said so, it can be safely assumed that he joined the rest of his congregation in fighting the fire and organizing the first company of the department. So, the days following the DeNoyelles fire striking posters in the biggest type then in vogue were distributed throughout the village. These posters or dodgers read: “FIRE, FIRE, FIRE ”!! ■‘Citizens of Haverstraw, will you meet with us on Saturday evening next, January the twenty-eighth, at the ball-room of the American Hotel, and assist in raising .an amount of money sufficient to purchase the necessary apparatus for a hook and ladder company “Signed: James Creney, Samuel Cosgrove, Samson Marks, John Begg, John Felter. C. I. Holliman, J. D. Bostwick, Jacob Allison, Alfred Hazzard and Robert Smith.’ This meeting was largely attended, fully one-half of the male population of the village attending. Owing to the failure to arrange the preliminaries the meeting was adjourned to the evening of February 18, 1854. The organization perfected of Rescue Hook and Ladder Company No. 1, with the following charter members: Asbury DeNoylles, James King, William Felter, John Jones, Daniel C.

      "Polhemus &amp; Coffin\nHenry M. Polhemus and Lewis Augustus Coffin, Jr formed the New York-based architectural firm of Polhemus & Coffin. Together they contributed to a joint publication, \"Small French Buildings: The Architecture of Town and Country\", with 183 plates of sketches, illustrations and photos, published by Charles Scribner & Sons in 1921. Their modest French country manor \"Mille Fleurs\" designed for Mrs Daniel Guggenheim on the extensive Gould-Guggenheim estate in Port Washington, New York, on the Gold Coast of Long Island, was completed in 1932; it is modeled on the vineyard Château Beauregard, Pommerol. In Newport, Rhode Island, they designed \"Champ Soleil\", on Bellevue Avenue, a small 22-room French manor that was completed in 1929. A lively debate currently underway on the internet, questions the inspiration for the design and whether or not Champ Soleil was modeled on the famous French Norman chateau named \"La Lanterne.\" a residence near Versailles. Designed for Lucy Drexel Dalgren in 1929, at one time Champ Soleil was the residence of Russell Aitken, artist, big game hunter, Associate Editor of Field & Stream Magazine and step-father of Sunny von Bülow.

      "Indian Hill House\nIndian Hill House is a private residence named for the Indian Hills of Groton, Massachusetts. Designed in 1962-63 by Maurice K. Smith, the house was built by Ralph S. Osmond & Sons. Osmond, who counts Boston shipwrights among his ancestors, is the son of Hedley F. Osmond, engineering manager for such notable Boston landmarks as the Hatch Memorial Shell, Fenway Park, and restoration of the inner roof of the Boston Public Library, McKim Building. Concept and construction of Indian Hill House were commissioned in 1962 by Arthur Floyd Blackman and his wife Camilla Cunningham Blackman. The influence of Mid-Century modern architecture is readily discernible here although Smith moves beyond this with an elaboration of his own \"Form Language\" - an approach to design that he developed throughout his teaching at the MIT School of Architecture and Planning. As such, it is very hard to align Smith's work with any stylistic movement per se, a fact that makes his designs all the more interesting. Other aspects that makes this house unique are that the light fixtures were fabricated on site from 4\" copper pipe, the windows were site built, and given the modular nature of the house in its original layout not one concrete block nor floor tile was cut. The house appears in several architectural works, including the Harvard Educational Review (1969), Spazio e Societa (June 1982) as Casa/House 1, and Progressive Architecture (March 1982), [3 images w/o notation].",
      "New York Society of Model Engineers\nThe New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City. There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905. In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan. AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building. In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races. It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\". Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations. Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout. During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces. Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled. The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort. The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort. As members returned after the War a new location was searched for. This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ. They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time. The space? Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City. Here the layout was built. It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa. It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.

      "Stanley Hart White\nStanley Hart White was a professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois from 1922 until 1959 and the inventor of the green wall. White called his invention \"Botanical Bricks\" and developed prototypes in his backyard in Urbana, Illinois. Stanley's brother E.B. White documents the invention in his 1937 letter to Katherine S. White: “I guess everyone has crazy brothers and sisters. I know I have. Stan, by the way, has taken out a patent on an invention of his called ‘Botanical Bricks,’ which are simply plant units capable of being built up to any height, for quick landscape effects, the vertical surfaces covered with flowering vines, or the like. He thinks that the idea has great possibilities for such things as world fairs, city yards, indoor gardens, and many other projects. I think perhaps he has got hold of something, and have written him for more information. He certainly deserves a break.” Stanley refined the vertical garden typology with his patent for the \"vegetation-Bearing Architectonic Structure and System (1938)\" in which he outlines the scope for a new field of vegetation-bearing architecture. The impact of this invention has still unrealized provocations on this history of gardens and designed landscapes, establishing precedent for verdant modernism in the prewar Middle West. The wall was reconstructed in 2012-13 as part of a Graham Foundation Research Award. Stanley Hart White is also known for his innovative teaching style and his influence on the work of Richard Haag, Hideo Sasaki, Peter Walker, Stu Dawson, Philip H. Lewis Jr., and numerous others Stanley Hart White married Blanche Bigney; they had one daughter, Janice Hart White, an accomplished artist. As E. B. White's niece, Janice was an inspiration for the title character in Stuart Little, Harper and Brothers, 1945.",

In addition, it was sung by Valerie Hobson in the original London West End production, and Marni Nixon (who only voiced-over songs while Deborah Kerr acted) in the 1956 film of \"The King and I\". The song is about Anna reminiscing over the idea of finding love at an English dance. The song comes about after a conflict of love's meaning between Anna and the King; the King believes that love is a \"silly complication of a pleasant simplicity\" and a \"fairy tale\" while Anna believes that love is real and is natural. They sing the song \"The Song of the King\" which expresses predominantly the viewpoint of the King. After the song, Anna is trying to explain the idea of love in a simple way to the King and becomes caught up in her own experience of love at first sight which is told in the song \"Shall We Dance?\".",

The idea of a Gasparilla-type observance centered on a “pirate” theme, and they unanimously chose as their patron pirate the notorious and legendary William Augustus Bowles, a pirate of controversial authenticity whose alleged dastardly deeds were widespread throughout the area. Nathan Fleet, a downtown Fort Walton Beach retail merchant at that time, was chosen as the first Captain Billy Bowlegs to reign over the Festival and lead the pirate “raids.” (In later years, his son, Judge Erwin Fleet, reigned as Cap’n Billy XIV.)",

At the top of your list of suspects is Loath Nolder, a highly respected private investigator who mysteriously abandoned his last case for reasons unknown. Rumor had it that he ventured to several exotic places around the world.

Although it is unknown exactly who led the coup attempt against President Sukarno, many relevant individuals and facts support the hypothesis that the PKI, particularly the Special Bureau, played a large role. Some underlying questions are still under discussion regarding PKI involvement in the 30th September Movement and consequent Indonesian Massacre of 1965: what was the role of the Special Bureau, who was the main perpetrator, and what motivation did the PKI have to overthrow a leader that supported them? These questions do not have definitive answers, and are explored most extensively in John Roosa’s \"Pretext for Mass Murder.\"",

No record exists of a captain by this name with Johnson generally considered a pseudonym for one of London's writer-publishers. Some scholars have suggested that \"Charles Johnson\" was actually Daniel Defoe writing under a pen name, but this is disputed. The prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates, Johnson gave an almost mythical status to the more colourful characters, and it is likely that the author used considerable artistic licence in his accounts of pirate conversations. First appearing in Charles Rivington's shop in London, the book sold so well that by 1726 an enlarged fourth edition had appeared.

      "Hurricane Connie\nHurricane Connie in August 1955 contributed to significant flooding across the eastern United States, just days before Hurricane Diane affected the same general area. Connie formed on August 3 from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It moved quickly west-northwestward, strengthening into a well-developed hurricane by August 5. Initially, it posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, although it passed about 50 mi north of the region. The outer rainbands produced hurricane-force wind gusts and intense precipitation, reaching 8.65 in in Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, three people died due to the hurricane, and a few homes were destroyed. In Puerto Rico, Connie destroyed 60 homes and caused crop damage. After affecting Puerto Rico, Connie turned to the northwest, reaching peak winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). The hurricane weakened while slowing and turning to the north, and struck North Carolina on August 12 at Category 2 intensity, the first of three damaging tropical cyclones in the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season to hit the state.",

Creator of the \"big-eyed waifs\", Keane is famous for drawing paintings with big eyes, and mainly paints women, children and animals in oil or mixed media.

In the original novels her name was just George, named for her grandfather, with, depending on the ghostwriter, a chain of either boys or girls ahead of her.) She has short black hair and brown eyes. She is an athletic tomboy, and is not easily scared when involved in Nancy's sleuthing. Her boyfriend is first a friend of Ned Nickerson's named Buck Rodman; she later dates Burt Eddleton. Bess and she were introduced to readers in \"The Secret at Shadow Ranch\". In the \"Nancy Drew Girl Detective Series\", she has a little brother named Scott.

A change in ghostwriters in 1933 resulted in George and her cousin Bess both being indicated as only children; their siblings, if there are any, are omitted from a will where their names are read. This can be explained in the text by assumption that they were the only children of their mothers known to their benefactor personally (\"The Sign of the Twisted Candles\").

The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named \"Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers\". The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people. Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers. For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting. None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched. Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia. During World War II, Ned was killed in action. When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis. Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca. It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin. Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit. When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe. In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time. He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them. By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville. In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers. Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler. Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass. This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none. Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry).

      "Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland\nMeet Me To-night in Dreamland was one of the most famous and beloved popular songs of the twentieth century. This gentle waltz, with poignant lyrics, was written by Beth Slater Whitson and Leo Friedman. It was published in Chicago in 1909. Friedman and Whitson sold it to the largest publisher in Chicago, Will Rossiter. Unfortunately, Rossiter never paid one cent to the authors in royalties. It was first introduced to the American public by Reine Davies (1883–1938), who was known as \"The New American Beauty,\" and by her friends as, \"The True Blue\" girl. Reine Davies first introduced the song in New York at the leading vaudeville house, and received countless encores for her artistic work. Vera Berliner, \"The Violinist With a Soul,\" played the chorus of this song, walking down the centre aisle, which made it an instantaneous success.",

      "Joseph Horn Cloud\nJoseph Horn Cloud born 1873 and died September 18, 1920. His father was Horn Cloud and mother Nest, both parents died at the Wounded Knee Massacre along with two brothers William Horn Cloud (1876-1890), Sherman Horn Cloud (1865-1890) and a niece. Joseph was a survivor of the massacre as well as his brother Daniel and half brother Dewey Beard [p. 89-95]. Dewey's mother was Yellow Leaf who also died during the massacre. In the early 1900s a writer named Eli S. Ricker began research for a book he was going to call \"The Final Conflict between the Red Men and the Palefaces.\" He gathered sources and interviews about conditions and battles on the Plains during the last half of the 1800s. He recorded the interviews in small note pads known to historians as the \"Ricker Tablets.\" One such interview was with Joseph telling Ricker what he witnessed at the Wounded Knee Massacre, \"When the shooting began the women ran to the ravine. The shooting was in every direction. Soldiers shot into one another... Many of the Indians in the circle were killed. Many of them mingled with the soldiers behind them, picking up guns from dead soldiers and taking cartridge belts.\"",
      "Bennington, Idaho\nBennington was one of the camping places for Indians that came through the Bear Lake valley each year on their hunting and fishing trips. They camped there until the 1930s, asking for food from the residents. An emigrant massacre happened at the mouth of four Mile Canyon. The emigrants head camp of the main road for better feed and plentiful water. A band of Shoshone led by \"Paughatello\" killed all the members of the company except for one 15-year-old boy, who hid in a wash and made his way back to another company. He went on to Oregon or California with the team. The battle spanned over 40 acres along the creek. Seven wagons, 20 people, 33 horses and 14 head of livestock were involved. Wagon parts, bones, cap and ball pistols, swords and other relics could be found decades later. The first town site of Bennington was located on block West on highway 30 at the Cemetery and Wright Roads, where the old Amos Wright log cabin still stands. The first settlers, Jared Bullock, and Jonathan Hoopes, came in the fall of 1864 and settled on the south side of Bennington Creek. Then Evan M. Greene, Hyrum Hoopes and Edmond Homer came. Six families spent the winter in 1864.In 1865 and 1866 more people were called to settle . In 1866 the community was officially named after a town in Vermont where Brigham Young once lived. In 1873 the town had a meeting, and the present town site was chosen. A church, school, store/post office and new homes were eventually built. Evan Green was the first Presiding Elder serving from 1864 to 1865, followed by Dudley Merrell, who presided until 1870, then Alonzo became the first Bishop. Church was held in a vacant house until one could be built. The first living white baby born Feb. 18, 1866 was Winnifred Rebecca Wright daughter of Amos R. Wright. The first death was Admanza Greene who died of pneumonia at age 10. Jared Bullock's wife died of childbirth. She was buried at the end of the haystack and then moved to the present cemetery later. Deep snow, cold weather and primitive living conditions made living here hard. A traveling band and a dancing academy taught by John Dunn was organized to help people get through the long winter mounts. In 1934 there was a terrible drought. At that time each home and building at the new town site had their own well. They all dried up except the one at the school so people carried water from there. The WPA helped with a new water system and during 1934-35 the men of the community dug ditches and laid the pipe to their homes. They had a big celebration at its completion in August 1936. Today Bennington is a thriving town with many new homes and a big church.",

She has written: \"I became Phillippa Yaa when I found my biological father, who told me that if he had been there when I was born, the first name I'd have been given would be a day name like all Ghanaian babies, and all Thursday girls are Yaa, Yawo, or Yaya. So by changing my name I intended to inscribe a feeling of belonging and also one of pride on my African side. After growing up black in white South Africa, internalising so many negative 'truths' of what black people are like, I needed to reclaim my humanity and myself from the toxic dance of objectification.\" She has also said: \"Because I wasn't told that I was adopted until I was twenty, I lacked a vocabulary to describe who I am and where I come from, so performing and writing became ways to make myself up.\" As Tishani Doshi observes in the \"New Indian Express\": \"Much of her work is concerned with race, sexuality, class and gender within the South African context.\"",

    "docs": [
      "Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nWhile the contributions of the Russian nationalistic group The Five were important in their own right in developing an independent Russian voice and consciousness in classical music, the compositions of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky became dominant in 19th century Russia, with Tchaikovsky becoming known both in and outside Russia as its greatest musical talent. His formal conservatory training allowed him to write works with Western-oriented attitudes and techniques, showcasing a wide range and breadth of technique from a poised \"Classical\" form simulating 18th century Rococo elegance to a style more characteristic of Russian nationalists or a musical idiom expressly to channel his own overwrought emotions.",
      "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and The Five\nIn mid- to late-19th-century Russia, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and a group of composers known as The Five had differing opinions as to whether should be composed following Western or native practices. Tchaikovsky wanted to write professional compositions of such quality that they would stand up to Western scrutiny and thus transcend national barriers, yet remain distinctively Russian in melody, rhythm and other compositional characteristics. The Five, made up of composers Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, sought to produce a specifically Russian kind of art music, rather than one that imitated older European music or relied on European-style conservatory training. While Tchaikovsky himself used folk songs in some of his works, for the most part he tried to follow Western practices of composition, especially in terms of tonality and tonal progression. Also, unlike Tchaikovsky, none of The Five were academically trained in composition; in fact, their leader, Balakirev, considered academicism a threat to musical imagination. Along with critic Vladimir Stasov, who supported The Five, Balakirev attacked relentlessly both the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which Tchaikovsky had graduated, and its founder Anton Rubinstein, orally and in print.",
      "Death of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nOn 6 November 1893 [O.S. 25 October] , nine days after the premiere of his Sixth Symphony, the \"Pathétique\", Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky died in Saint Petersburg, at the age of 53. The official cause of death was reported to be cholera, most probably contracted through drinking contaminated water several days earlier. This explanation was accepted by many biographers of the composer. However, even at the time of Tchaikovsky's death, there were many questions about this diagnosis.",
      "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and the Belyayev circle\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's relations with the group of composers known as the Belyayev circle, which lasted from 1887 until Tchaikovsky's death in 1893, influenced all of their music and briefly helped shape the next generation of Russian composers. This group was named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Alexander Glazunov's work. By 1887, Tchaikovsky was firmly established as one of the leading composers in Russia. A favorite of Tsar Alexander III, he was widely regarded as a national treasure. He was in demand as a guest conductor in Russia and Western Europe, and in 1890 visited the United States in the same capacity. By contrast, the fortunes of the nationalistic group of composers known as The Five, which preceded the Belyayev circle, had waned, and the group had long since dispersed; of its members, only Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer. Now a professor of musical composition and orchestration at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov had become a firm believer in the Western-based compositional training that had been once frowned upon by the group.",
      "Symphonies by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form, the primary Western principle for building large-scale musical structures since the middle of the 18th century. Traditional Russian treatment of melody, harmony and structure actually worked against sonata form's \"modus operandi\" of movement, growth and development. Russian music—the Russian creative mentality as a whole, in fact—functioned on the principle of stasis. Russian novels, plays and operas were written as collections of self-contained tableaux, with the plots proceeding from one set-piece to the next. Russian folk music operated along the same lines, with songs comprised as a series of self-contained melodic units repeated continually. Compared to this mindset, the precepts of sonata form probably seemed as alien as if they had arrived from the moon.",
      "Ballet (music)\nBallet as a music form progressed from simply a complement to dance, to a concrete compositional form that often had as much value as the dance that went along with it. The dance form, originating in France during the 17th century, began as a theatrical dance. It was not until the 19th century that ballet gained status as a “classical” form. In ballet, the terms ‘classical’ and ‘romantic’ are chronologically reversed from musical usage. Thus, the 19th century classical period in ballet coincided with the 19th century Romantic era in Music. Ballet music composers from the 17th–19th centuries, including the likes of Jean-Baptiste Lully and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, were predominantly in France and Russia. Yet with the increased international notoriety seen in Tchaikovsky’s lifetime, ballet music composition and ballet in general spread across the western world.",
      "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ( ; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский ; 25 April/7 May 1840 – 25 October/6 November 1893), often anglicized as Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky, was a Russian composer of the romantic period, some of whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. Tchaikovsky was honored in 1884, by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension.",
      "Alexandro Marie Antoin Fridzeri\nAlexandro Marie Antoin Fridzeri or Frixer (born Verona January 16, 1741, died Antwerp 1825) was the most renowned of mandolin virtuosi, a clever violinist, organist, and a composer whose works met with popular favor. Among his works were sonatas and chamber music and operas. His life began and ended with tragic notes, losing his eyesight and later his home and possessions. Music historian Philip J. Bone called Fridzeri \" an artist of undoubted genius and a man of most remarkable character, which was fully tried under great adversity.\" The late Giuseppe Bellenghi, mandolinist and composer, dedicated his variations for mandolin and piano on the \"Carnival of Venice\", to the memory of Fridzeri, the blind mandolin player and composer.",

He is considered to be one of the greatest cellists of the 20th century. In addition to his interpretations and technique, he was well known for both inspiring and commissioning new works, which enlarged the cello repertoire more than any cellist before or since. He inspired and premiered over 100 pieces, forming long-standing friendships and artistic partnerships with composers including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Henri Dutilleux, Witold Lutosławski, Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Krzysztof Penderecki, Alfred Schnittke, Norbert Moret, Andreas Makris and Benjamin Britten.",
      "Kamarinskaya\nKamarinskaya (Russian: камаринская ) is a Russian traditional folk dance, which is mostly known today as the Russian composer Mikhail Glinka's composition of the same name. Glinka's \"Kamarinskaya\", written in 1848, was the first orchestral work based entirely on Russian folk song and to use the compositional principles of that genre to dictate the form of the music. It became a touchstone for the following generation of Russian composers ranging from the Western-oriented Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to the group of nationalists known collectively as The Five and was also lauded abroad, most notably by French composer Hector Berlioz.",
      "Russian literature\nRussian literature refers to the literature of Russia and its émigrés and to the Russian-language literature of several independent nations once a part of what was historically Rus', the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union. The roots of Russian literature can be traced to the Middle Ages, when epics and chronicles in Old Russian were composed. By the Age of Enlightenment, literature had grown in importance, and from the early 1830s, Russian literature underwent an astounding golden age in poetry, prose and drama. Romanticism permitted a flowering of poetic talent: Vasily Zhukovsky and later his protégé Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. Prose was flourishing as well. The first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol. Then came Ivan Turgenev, who mastered both short stories and novels. Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky soon became internationally renowned. In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and became a leading dramatist. The beginning of the 20th century ranks as the Silver Age of Russian poetry. The poets most often associated with the \"Silver Age\" are Konstantin Balmont, Valery Bryusov, Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Nikolay Gumilyov, Osip Mandelstam, Sergei Yesenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Marina Tsvetaeva and Boris Pasternak. This era produced some first-rate novelists and short-story writers, such as Aleksandr Kuprin, Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin, Leonid Andreyev, Fyodor Sologub, Aleksey Remizov, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Andrei Bely.",
      "Musical quotation\nSometimes the quotation is done for the purposes of characterization, as in Puccini's use of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in reference to the American character Lieutenant Pinkerton in his opera \"Madama Butterfly\", or in Tchaikovsky's use of the Russian and French national anthems in the \"1812 Overture\", which depicted a battle between the Russian and French armies.",
      "Mikhail Azanchevsky\nMikhail Pavlovich (von) Azanchevsky (Russian: Михаи́л Па́влович (фон) Азанче́вский ), March 3 [O.S. April 5] 1839 – January 12 [O.S. January 24] 1881 ) was a Russian composer and music teacher. He was the director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory in 1871-1876. Not long before his death, Edward Dannreuther called him \"one of the most cultivated of living Russian musicians,\" and commented on \"the delicate finish of diction and form which characterises his compositions, as well as for the extensive range of his knowledge in musical matters generally.\"",
      "Festival Overture on the Danish National Anthem\nDuring his time at the Moscow Conservatoire, around September 1866 the school's principal, Nikolay Rubinstein commissioned Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to compose a Festival Overture on the Danish National Anthem to be played for the visit of the Tsarevich (heir to the throne) to Moscow, accompanied by his new Danish bride, Princess Dagmar of Denmark. The Tsarrevich would eventually be crowned Tsar Alexander III of Russia and remain a devoted follower of Tchaikovsky's music, awarding the composer both the Order of St. Vladimir (Fourth Class) in 1884 and a state pension in 1885.",

He was a master of orchestration. His best-known orchestral compositions—\"Capriccio Espagnol\", the \"Russian Easter Festival Overture\", and the symphonic suite \"Scheherazade\"—are staples of the classical music repertoire, along with suites and excerpts from some of his 15 operas. \"Scheherazade\" is an example of his frequent use of fairy tale and folk subjects.",
      "Mily Balakirev\nMily Alexeyevich Balakirev (Russian: Ми́лий Алексе́евич Бала́кирев , ] ; 2 January 1837  – 29 May [O.S. 16 May] 1910 ) was a Russian pianist, conductor and composer known today primarily for his work promoting musical nationalism and his encouragement of more famous Russian composers, notably Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. He began his career as a pivotal figure, extending the fusion of traditional folk music and experimental classical music practices begun by composer Mikhail Glinka. In the process, Balakirev developed musical patterns that could express overt nationalistic feeling. After a nervous breakdown and consequential sabbatical, he returned to classical music but did not wield the same level of influence as before.",

Born as Russian classical music was flourishing in the middle of the 19th century, he worked with many of the important composers and musicians of the day, including performances with Anton Rubinstein and Alexander Siloti. As a soloist, he excelled in performance and was especially noted for stylish interpretations, his refined temperament, and beautiful, expressive tone. In his later years, he became a professor at Moscow Conservatory, and continued to perform well into his later life.

His work on \"Swan Lake\" was considered unsuccessful by the critics of the day but not necessarily unsuccessful by the theatre-going public—after all, Reisinger's original production of \"Swan Lake\" was kept in the active repertoire of the Bolshoi Theatre for seven years and was performed over thirty times during a period when other ballets could not sustain even twenty performances. In fact, the production was not pulled until the scenery and costumes were worn and threadbare.

Though his songs were never overtly political (in contrast to those of some of his fellow Soviet bards), the freshness and independence of Okudzhava's artistic voice presented a subtle challenge to Soviet cultural authorities, who were thus hesitant for many years to give official recognition to Okudzhava.",

      "Lorenzo Perosi\nMonsignor Lorenzo Perosi (21 December 1872 – 12 October 1956) was an Italian composer of sacred music and the only member of the Giovane Scuola who did not write opera. In the late 1890s, while he was still only in his 20s, Perosi was an internationally celebrated composer of sacred music, especially large-scale oratorios. Nobel Prize winner Romain Rolland wrote, \"It's not easy to give you an exact idea of how popular Lorenzo Perosi is in his native country.\" Perosi's fame was not restricted to Europe. A 19 March 1899 \"New York Times\" article entitled \"The Genius of Don Perosi\" began, \"The great and ever-increasing success which has greeted the four new oratorios of Don Lorenzo Perosi has placed this young priest-composer on a pedestal of fame which can only be compared with that which has been accorded of late years to the idolized Pietro Mascagni by his fellow-countrymen.\" Gianandrea Gavazzeni made the same comparison: \"The sudden clamors of applause, at the end of the [19th] century, were just like those a decade earlier for Mascagni.\" Perosi worked for five Popes, including Pope St. Pius X who greatly fostered his rise.",

In 1959, he published his first collection of poetry, \"Watermelons\" which contained an introduction by Allen Ginsberg and a prefatory letter by William Carlos Williams.

That was in 1991,\" Heinsohn told Inside Mac Games in a July 2012 interview. \"We then formed a baseball club and started playing in organized baseball leagues in 1994. In the meantime I played all sorts of baseball computer games, but there was no management-related game that I liked, so in 1998 I decided to simply develop my own game, just for fun. When it was done in 1999, I figured it was probably good enough to earn some money with it, and that’s when it all started.\"",

The series achieved the status of a cult film in the USSR, and along with \"Seventeen Moments of Spring\" became a part of popular culture with several generations of Russian-speaking TV viewers. The series stars singer-songwriter Vladimir Vysotsky in one of his final screen appearances (his death at the age of 42 came less than a year after the film's release). Soviet screen and stage legends Sergey Yursky, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, Zinovy Gerdt, Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev, and Leonid Kuravlev also appear in the film.",

He was most famous for his ellipsoid algorithm (1979) for linear programming, which was the first such algorithm known to have a polynomial running time. Even though this algorithm was shown to be impractical due to the high degree of the polynomial in its running time, it has inspired other randomized algorithms for convex programming and is considered a significant theoretical breakthrough.",
      "Mikhail Sushkov\nMikhail Vasilyevich Sushkov (Russian: Михаил Васильевич Сушков) (1775–1792) was a young Russian nobleman and writer of a small body of prose and poetry, notable for his autobiographical suicide novel. He committed suicide by hanging at age 17 after writing four suicide notes, one of which was to his uncle Alexander Khrapovitsky, at that moment personal secretary of empress Catherine the Great. Empress Catherine is said to have told Khrapovitskiy: \"I am sorry for his parents, who lost such a fine son. But most of all I am sorry for himself. If he had stayed alive, he soon would have outshone Voltaire\". Sushkov’s suicide notes, the report on his death by the Moscow police, and reactions by contemporaries, not only document the suicide in great detail, but give a rare close-up of a phenomenon that was seen as a highly significant ‘sign of the time’.",

Ter-Vaganyan was one of sixteen Soviet intellectuals who stood as defendants during the Moscow Show Trials. He was accused of being part of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite centre which allegedly prepared terrorist acts against Stalin, Klim Voroshilov, Andrei Zhdanov, Lazar Kaganovich, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Stanislav Kosior, and Pavel Postyshev.

Various literary critics, most notably Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Roy Medvedev, claimed that Mikhail Sholokov plagiarised his work in order to write major parts of \"And Quiet Flows the Don\". This was also the conclusion of a statistical analysis by V. P. and T. G. Fomenko. Their conclusion has been questioned by a more recent analysis. Ze'ev Bar-Sela believes that although the book was plagiarised, it was plagiarised from Venyamin Alekseevich Krasnushkin (Вениамин Алексеевич Краснушкин ), and not from Kryukov. A 1984 monograph by Geir Kjetsaa and others concluded through statistical analyses that Sholokhov was the likely author of \"Don\".",

Khrennikov called their music \"pointlessness... and noisy mud instead of real musical innovation\".

Some sources say, that they were put under official boycott . Newer research shows, that this might be a politically distorted perception . Inside the USSR, the speech was almost without consequences for the composers, however in the west it was taken as a proof of restrictive cultural politics. Publishers use this speech to promote their composers to this day. The composers themselves understood, that such rumours would likely be heard in the West.

      "Russian literature\nRussian literature refers to the literature of Russia and its émigrés and to the Russian-language literature of several independent nations once a part of what was historically Rus', the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union. The roots of Russian literature can be traced to the Middle Ages, when epics and chronicles in Old Russian were composed. By the Age of Enlightenment, literature had grown in importance, and from the early 1830s, Russian literature underwent an astounding golden age in poetry, prose and drama. Romanticism permitted a flowering of poetic talent: Vasily Zhukovsky and later his protégé Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. Prose was flourishing as well. The first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol. Then came Ivan Turgenev, who mastered both short stories and novels. Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky soon became internationally renowned. In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and became a leading dramatist. The beginning of the 20th century ranks as the Silver Age of Russian poetry. The poets most often associated with the \"Silver Age\" are Konstantin Balmont, Valery Bryusov, Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Nikolay Gumilyov, Osip Mandelstam, Sergei Yesenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Marina Tsvetaeva and Boris Pasternak. This era produced some first-rate novelists and short-story writers, such as Aleksandr Kuprin, Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin, Leonid Andreyev, Fyodor Sologub, Aleksey Remizov, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Andrei Bely.",

Count Khvostov, as he was widely known, was an exceedingly prolific author of poems, fables, epigrams, etc., invariably archaic and pompous, making him an easy target for humourists and fellow poets (Pushkin among them) who ridiculed him relentelessly. In modern times much has been done to separate the comical myth from Khvostov's real legacy (with some fake 'Khvostovism' exposed) and give credit to an extraordinary poetry enthusiast (who was also an avid literary researcher and archivist), but the stereotype prevails and the name of Count Khvostov remains synonymous in Russia with wanton graphomania and self-important pomposity.",

Smith stated that he had been born in Liberia in 1842 and kidnapped to the United States at age 12 and sold into slavery in Louisiana to a Texas rancher. Later research indicated that he had been born circa 1874 or even later. In particular, his marriage certificate, issued January 8, 1910, listed him as being 35 years old at the time. He died in Bartow, Florida in 1979, at the age of 105 (according to researchers) or 137 (according to his own claim). Later subsequent research showed Mr. Smith listed in the 1900 census as 21, suggesting he could have been only 100 years old. It is possible that he was given the birth name Mitchell Watkins and adopted at an early age in the years right after the Civil War with his \"memories\" embellishments from stories told by older ex-slaves; but evidence of this is spotty and it is unlikely that such an adoption would be verifiable, with records quite unreliable right after the Civil War.",

      "Bernhard, schavuit van Oranje\nBernhard, schavuit van Oranje (English title: Bernhard, scoundrel of Orange) is a Dutch television program depicting the more than only turbulent life of a prince consort. It is a compelling drama concerning a man who tries to be himself, but must survive deep crises, finally to see the real meaning of love. Within the Dutch royal family there is actually no more talked about character than Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. Whether it concerns Greet Hofmans, extramarital affairs, or Lockheed, Prince Bernhard faced a lot of scandals throughout the course of his life. Besides this he was, and is a person, loved by many as a war hero. A man of extremes. In four parts Prince Bernhard tells the tale of his life. Not only through the spyglass, but especially to his grandson's wife, Princess Máxima of the Netherlands, who will be soon the Queen next to Prince Willem-Alexander. In a way, she takes the same position as Prince Bernhard did in his life. In their conversations and discussions it becomes clear how much they are different, but also how much they are the same. For Princess Máxima this is sometimes very confronting. The tale drags us throughout the course of the Prince's life, from Soestdijk, his beloved German Reckenwalde, Berlin, London, Argentina and Canada.",

This Bengali-Oriya film is a remake of Rakesh Roshan's film \"Karan Arjun\" on the theme of reincarnation.

The Queen City Kings were formed by a Vice Lord member who moved to Charlotte from Chicago in the mid 1990s. He initially established a Vice Lord faction in the Cedar Greene Apartment Complex but as a way to be inclusive of another Vice Lord, an agreement was made by all parties involved to change the name of the gang to the Queen City Kings, which played on the nickname of the City of Charlotte, which people dub the \"Queen City.\" The name, according to the Original Kings, was the gang's affirmation to the claiming of the city, stating: \"The Queen City is our bitch, which makes us the Kings.\" Shortly thereafter, he was incarcerated on an unrelated offense. A Cedar Greene Apartments resident named \"Corn,\" along with Corn's half-brother, was left in charge. Corn proved to be a very charismatic and dedicated leader, remaining loyal to the movement until his suicide, several years later. The Kings, which originally stood for Knowledgeable Islamic Nubian Gods, then renamed Krucial Islamic Nubian Gods, was meant to be a Charlotte, home-grown version of the Chicago Vice Lords. The Kings were structured similar to the Los Angeles gangs, but instead of \"Original Gangsta\" (OG) or \"Baby Gangsta\" (BG) the Queen City Kings used \"Original King\" (OK) or \"Baby King\" (BK).

Just as the Vice Lords in Chicago had different branches, or \"sets,\" the Queen City Kings had a number of small sets as well. These sets were actually small groups of members who lived in different Charlotte communities, who were dedicated to spreading the Kingz to each of these neighborhoods. Some of them were successful but many of them were unknown in their respective neighborhoods. Among the factions were the Wilmore Kings (WMK), Tuckaseegee Kings (TSK), Beatties Ford Kings (BFK), Derita King (DTK), North Side Jamaican Kings (NJK), Westside Kings (WSK) the Creek Town Kings (CTK or FOC), The Cedar Greene Kings (CGK), the Woodview Kings (WVK), the Hidden Valley Kings (HVK) among others of these various sets, the Hidden Valley Kings became the most prominent.",

By merging the new technologies at the time, building small inexpensive studios armed with computers and samplers rather than traditional instruments and studio equipment, and the latest dance music trends (house, techno, hip-hop, electro, etc.) with the Scandinavian focus since ABBA on mixing strong pop melodies with catchy hooks, both a new sound and a new way of making music were born. A commonly recognized birth date for the movement has become the October 1987 cover story of ID Magazine in the UK, a cover graced by the first international Afro-Scandinavian pop star, La Camilla from Army of Lovers, as the face of the brand new Nordik Beat movement.",
